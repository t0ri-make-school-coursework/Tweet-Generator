PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
Havana, a vibrant, historic port city where the winds of change blow strong, is home to Overwatch’s newest Escort map!
Begin your trip at the Taller de Sebastián, where the classic cars that line Havana’s bustling streets stop for refueling and repair. Escort a truck of rum barrels on the sun-drenched cobblestone roads, fighting off those who try to stop you. As you make your way, duck into a colorful building to escape enemy fire and savor the impressive flavors of Havana at La Cocina de Miranda or Café del Sol. Battle your opponents through the alleys until you reach the Don Rumbotico rum distillery, a once little-known local treasure that has recently earned international acclaim. Finally, guide the jalopy through the distillery to its destination at the Havana Sea Fort, a historical landmark recently purchased by an anonymous financial group and closed to the public.

HERO UPDATES
Developer Comments: With this change, we’re looking to slightly increase the range at which Junkrat can land direct hits. The speed of his bombs has increased, but we tuned it so this wouldn’t affect the arc of his projectile. This means that aiming with it will feel the same. The grenades bounce less and explode sooner, which will allow Junkrat to aim them more deliberately. This will reduce the amount of rolling grenade spam when playing against him.
Projectile speed increased from 20 to 25
Grenades now bounce less but explode sooner
Developer Comments: Shadow Step was originally intended to be purely an out-of-combat mobility tool to traverse the map, since Wraith Form was already a great tool for disengaging. However, this made Shadow Step very situational, so we’re increasing its flexibility to make it a better, less niche ability. This will enable Reaper to use Shadow Step in more offensive situations.
Can now be used in air
Time to exit Shadow Step reduced from 1.0 second to 0.5 of a second
Reaper is now invisible for the entire time it takes to exit shadow step
Railings and other breakable objects no longer block teleporting
Disabled by Zarya’s Graviton Surge and Junkrat’s Steel Trap

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
Baptiste is battle-hardened combat medic who wields an assortment of experimental devices and weaponry to keep allies alive and eliminate his enemies. Baptiste’s Biotic Launcher fires a three-round-burst that rewards accuracy and recoil control with significant damage output. His alternate fire lobs grenades that heal allies near the point of impact. With Regenerative Burst, Baptiste activates an intense surge that heals himself and nearby allies over time. When danger is near, Baptiste can toss out his Immortality Field to prevent allies from dying. Baptiste moves around the battlefield with Exo Boots, jumping over obstacles and clearing distances that would stop other heroes. Baptiste deploys his Amplification Matrix as his ultimate, which doubles the damage and healing effects of friendly projectiles.
GENERAL UPDATES
Armor
Developer Comments: The damage taken by armor from damage over time effects, such as Widowmaker’s Venom Mine, and beam weapons, like Symmetra’s Photon Projector, varied greatly. Now it will be more consistent and predictable.
Beam-type damage is now reduced by 20% when hitting armor
Mei: Primary Fire
Moira: Alternate Fire, Coalescence
Symmetra: Primary Fire, Sentry Turret
Winston: Primary Fire
Zarya: Primary Fire
Damage over time effects are no longer mitigated by armor
Ana: Primary Fire
Ashe: Dynamite
Hanzo: Dragonstrike
Mei: Blizzard
Moira: Biotic Orb
Widowmaker: Venom Mine
Zarya: Graviton Surge
Damage Boost
Developer Comments: Previously, the effects of damage boosting were only accounted for if the damage-dealing hero was being boosted as they landed a hit. Now, damage is applied to the projectile as it is fired. This means the damage-dealing hero doesn’t need to be boosted when the projectile hits an enemy for the damage boost to be accounted for.
Damage boost is now applied when a projectile is fired rather than when it hits a target
Knockback
Developer Comments: Knockbacks are now less affected by how the enemy was moving when they were hit. Instead of having small or large knockbacks that depend on chance, knockbacks will feel similar regardless of the enemy’s movement leading up to the knockback. Allowing flying heroes, like Mercy when using her Valkyrie ability or D.Va using her Booster ability, to be properly knocked back makes for more fluid, realistic gameplay.
Knockback distance is now more consistent
Heroes that are flying can now be knocked back and slowed
Sound
Developer Comments: With the addition of Baptiste, we wanted to be sure that you can tell when your hits were being buffed or nullified, regardless of what hero you’re playing.
A new sound plays when you land a hit while damage boosted
A new sound plays when you land a hit, but it doesn’t do any damage
HERO UPDATES
Developer Comments: Giving Nano Boost an instant heal effect enabled players to survive longer and made Ana’s ultimate valuable. However, it was a bit too strong when healing heroes with large health pools.
Heal reduced from 300 to 250
Developer Comments: Reducing the downtime of Doomfist’s abilities will give him some power back and make his gameplay feel more fluid.
Cooldown reduced from 7 to 6 seconds
Cooldown reduced from 7 to 6 seconds
Developer Comments: Because of how dense the environment is on some maps, the Sonic Arrow can feel ineffective in some areas. Increasing Sonic Arrow’s detection radius should make it more effective.
Detection radius increased from 7 to 9 meters
Developer Comments: Junkrat is one of the best barrier and tank busters in the game, and this change will help solidify this role. This doesn’t change the Frag Launcher’s explosive damage, which remains at 80. The total damage for direct impact is now 130, up from 120. Since we increased Frag Launcher’s damage output, Junkrat builds his ultimate too quickly. We’re increasing the cost of his ultimate to balance this change with his increased damage-dealing capabilities.
Impact damage increased from 40 to 50
Cost increased by 10%
Developer Comments: The knockback on Lúcio's Soundwave is a great tool for pushing enemies into situations that get them killed, so they should be rewarded an offensive assist for doing so. Lúcio’s ability to increase his teammate’s speed was too strong, especially when used on high health/low range heroes. We’re decreasing the overall power of Lúcio's Speed Boost but increasing the speed bonus he gets from using Wall Ride so his mobility isn’t impacted too much.
Speed Boost’s amplification reduced from 70% to 50%
Speed Boost’s effect reduced from 30% to 20%
Soundwave now counts towards Offensive Assists
Speed buff increased from 20% to 40%
Developer Comments: After reducing armor’s effectiveness for all heroes, Fan the Hammer doesn’t need to deal quite as much damage. Increasing Deadeye’s damage after being locked on for a bit makes it more effective when attacking high health, static targets (like barriers) and heroes with over 250 health. It will not impact how dangerous this is for heroes under 250 health.
Damage reduced from 55 to 50
Damage per second increased from 275 to 550 after locking onto targets for 1.5 seconds
Developer Comments: Increasing the damage of Mei’s primary fire should make her Freeze and Icicle move combination more potent. Making the pillars on Mei’s Ice Wall easier to destroy means less waiting for the wall to disappear on its own and more opportunities to counter it.
Primary fire damage increased from 2.25 to 2.75 (45 to 55 damage per second)
Health reduced from 500 to 400
Developer Comments: These minor changes make Moira’s passive healing effect on Biotic Grasp slightly more effective when topping off an ally’s health.
Heal over time duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds
Total healing increased from 50 to 65
Developer Comments: As a defensive tank, Orisa can have trouble pushing forward with the team. Allowing Orisa to move faster while firing should make it easier to apply pressure on the enemy team and use her barrier in proactive ways.
Movement speed penalty while firing reduced from 50% to 30%
Developer Comments: This change should potentially allow Soldier: 76 to kill an enemy hero one shot sooner. Reducing the time between when you use Sprint and when you can fire should make the ability more fluid and responsive. Giving Tactical Visor the ability to target Junkrat’s RIP-Tire and Baptiste’s Immortality Field drone is a quality of life improvement, since these are both critical targets.
Damage increased from 19 to 20
Delay before you can fire the weapon after using Sprint reduced from .5 to .3 seconds
Can target RIP-Tire and Immortality Field
Developer Comments: The cooldown on Hack often made it feel less effective to target health packs instead of players. This will make both health packs and players viable targets for hacking.
Cooldown is reduced by half when hacking a health pack
Changed the visual appearance to more clearly indicate when something has been hacked
Developer Comments: Torbjörn’s survivability was a bit low, so we’ve shifted some power from his Overload ability to his base health.
Base health increased by 50 armor (250 maximum health)
Armor gain reduced from 150 to 100
Developer Comments: Infra-Sight had no counter to its effect, so it now ends when Widowmaker dies. To balance out its higher risk of use, Infra-Sight now reveals enemy health bars to Widowmaker’s team.
Reveals enemy health bars
Now canceled on death
Developer Comments: Zarya’s damage greatly increases when at high energy, while also gaining increased beam size and a larger explosion radius. This often allowed Zarya to deal too much damage and made the explosions from the Alternate Fire on her Particle Cannon nearly impossible to avoid. This change will still allow Zarya to deal a lot of damage, but makes it more difficult to actually apply the damage.
Alternative Fire’s explosion radius changed to 2 meters, regardless of energy level
Developer Comments: Zenyatta’s Orb of Discord makes him a nearly irreplaceable support hero on your team. We’re reducing its impact for Zenyatta’s team, but increasing the potency of the Orb of Destruction to compensate for its lesser effect.
Damage increased from 46 to 48
Effect reduced from 30% to 25%

Fixed a bug where Hanzo’s leg would visibly move while he was in his Meditate pose
Mercy
Fixed a bug where Mercy’s left knee would bend unnaturally when stunned by McCree’s Flashbang
Orisa
Fixed a bug that made Orisa very difficult to knock back while she was firing her Fusion Driver
Reaper
Fixed a bug where a button on the shoulder of Reaper’s Lu Bu skin appeared to be floating
Reinhardt

Fixed an issue that allowed Reinhardt’s Earthshatter to hit people further off the ground than intended in specific circumstances

Fixed a bug where Sombra’s stealth exiting sound effect wouldn’t play if an emote was used to exit stealth mode
Fixed a bug where Sombra couldn’t quick melee while using her Hack ability
Symmetra
Fixed a bug where Symmetra would gain ultimate charge while casting Photon Barrier
Torbjörn
Fixed a bug that prevented Torbjörn from using Molten Core in custom games if Ability 2 was disabled
Widowmaker
Fixed a bug that prevented Widowmaker’s Venom Mine from damaging a hero if they triggered it at the edge of its trigger radius
Hollywood
Fixed a bug where the winning team’s hero lineup wouldn’t display correctly

Once you establish dominance over your adversaries, make your way to Maison Marat and deliver the coup-de-grâce.
HERO UPDATES
General
Developer Comments: In Overwatch, a health type order determines the prioritization of subtracting health, shield, or armor types when a hero takes damage. For example, if a hero has recoverable shields and takes damage, the damage taken will diminish the recoverable shield before it subtracts from their recoverable health. Previously, it was possible for heroes’ recoverable shields to be prioritized for damage and regeneration, allowing their non-recoverable armor to persist. With the order adjustment, heroes who have been granted non-recoverable armor or shields will now consume those resources before recoverable health, armor, or shields.
Non-recoverable health, shields, and armor are now consumed before recoverable health, shields, and armor
Previous priority order: non-recoverable shields, recoverable shields, non-recoverable armor, recoverable armor, non-recoverable health, and recoverable health
New priority order: non-recoverable shields, non-recoverable armor, non-recoverable health, recoverable shields, recoverable armor, and recoverable health

HERO UPDATES
General
Developer Comments: Before this change, armor reduced all incoming damage by up to 5, maxing at half of the normal amount. This change reduces the damage reduction to 3, while still capping at half. This change will be most noticeable for heroes who fire quickly or in bursts, such as shotguns, and do more than 6 damage per shot. For example, Soldier: 76’s Heavy Pulse Rifle will now do 16 damage per shot to armored opponents, up from 14 (an increase close to 15%).
Armor was a bit too strong overall, especially when heroes were being healed quickly and often. This change will help more heroes fight against higher-armored enemies.
Damage reduction from armor reduced from -5 to -3
Developer Comments: Sometimes Rally could cause a snowballing effect, making it too difficult to deal with the increased health of Brigitte’s allies before she built up another one. This change limits how long Rally’s effect lasts after its initial cast, to make it a bit more manageable in those situations.
Now has a maximum duration of 30 seconds
Developer Comments Reaper’s passive enables him to play aggressively when near enemies. This change allows him to keep the pressure up while he’s dishing damage to his enemies. The added life steal is particularly effective against tanks, as they tend to do less damage than other heroes, and also take more damage from his Hellfire Shotguns due to their larger hit volumes.
Life steal increased from 30% to 50% of damage dealt
BUG FIXES

GENERAL UPDATES
Audio
An option to use Windows Spatial Audio is now available. This feature can be found in the Windows Start Menu under Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Sound > Speaker Device > Spatial Sound
Developer Comments: Since launch, we’ve supported Dolby Atmos for players who use headphones, and we’re now expanding this support to include the Windows 10 implementation for spatial audio. Spatial audio is configured in the Windows 10 sound settings and will take priority over the settings in the game client. This will allow for more options, including settings for Windows Sonic Headphones, Dolby Atmos for Headphones, and Dolby Atmos for Home Theater.
HERO UPDATES
Ashe
B.O.B.
Bob will now have a golden tint when Ashe equips her golden weapon
Developer Comments: Our final technical audit on Ashe’s character package allowed us to implement a feature we talked about several times during Bob’s production. Making him part of Ashe’s golden weapon is a great way to celebrate our favorite Big Omnic Butler and let players show off their hard-earned Competitive Points each time they summon him onto the battlefield.
Bastion
Configuration: Recon
Ammo increased from 25 to 35
Configuration: Sentry
Weapon spread decreased by up to 33% while firing
Developer Comments: Bastion could use a little bit of an offensive boost to balance out how vulnerable Configuration: Recon’s bulky size and Sentry’s stationary nature make it. As a reward for surviving in spite of these weaknesses, we gave Bastion a lower spread in Sentry mode to make it more effective at farther ranges than it was previously.
Brigitte
Shield Bash
No longer can travel or stun targets through barriers
Damage reduced from 50 to 5
Inspire
Cooldown reduced from 1.5 seconds to 1 second
Duration increased from 5 seconds to 6 seconds
Total healing increased from 80 to 100
Developer Comments: Brigitte’s Shield Bash is a strong ability that often feels difficult to counter. This change will offer new options for counter play, enabling shield tanks to better protect themselves and their teammates. Reducing its damage reduces her total stun combo damage potential while still allowing Whip Shot and her basic melee attacks to retain their full strength. Brigitte is a tank/healer hybrid, and lately we’ve been reducing her effectiveness by lowering the power of her non-healing functionality. We want to make sure she is still a viable pick, so we’re increasing the uptime of her Inspire passive ability to help improve her overall healing output.
Doomfist
Rising Uppercut
Loss of air control duration lowered from 3 seconds to 0.6 seconds
Seismic Slam
Maximum range reduced from 20 meters to 15 meters
Targets no longer lose air control while being pulled in
Meteor Strike
Inner ring damage radius increased from 1.5 meters to 2.0 meters
Outer ring maximum damage decreased from 300 to 200
Developer Comments: Doomfist’s high mobility allows him to engage and disengage from extremely long range. Decreasing the range of the targeted aerial version of Seismic Slam requires him to get closer before engaging an enemy and makes it slightly harder for him to escape from combat. The loss of air control on Rising Uppercut was a frustrating mechanic for players, but it allowed Doomfist to set up combos. We’ve found a decent middle ground by limiting the amount of time Doomfist has to line up his next move. The Meteor Strike changes will make it harder to secure easy eliminations on heroes without mobility abilities, such as Zenyatta or Ana, while still preserving its maximum potential damage when aimed well or when combined with other abilities such as Graviton Surge or Sleep Dart.
McCree
Peacekeeper
Alternate fire damage increased from 45 to 55
Developer Comments: McCree’s Fan the Hammer wasn’t as reliable against higher health heroes as it should be. Increasing its damage will make it more potent in close-range engagements where it is intended to be most effective.
Soldier: 76
Tactical Visor
No longer makes Helix Rockets lock onto enemies
Developer Comments: The intent of Tactical Visor is to make Soldier: 76 unable to miss during its duration. However, Helix Rockets have travel time, so if they were fired directly at an enemy after locking on they would often miss a moving target at further ranges. This change allows players to freely aim Helix Rockets while still auto-aiming his primary fire.
Torbjörn
Molten Core
Damage increased from 130 to 160 per second
Developer Comments: While the Molten Core damage pools were intended to provide players with tools for area denial, they weren’t proving threatening enough to deter enemies for a significant amount of time because their damage was too low.

You can also colorize enemy and friendly UI separately. These options can be found under Options > Video > Color Blind Options. All changes made will be saved and ready for you to see in the next match you play!
GENERAL UPDATES
General
Updated the audio mix to add more clarity and dynamic range for all sounds in the game
Developer Comments: We’ve added more heroes and features to the game, so the audio mix has become more complex, which required us to rebalance sounds across the game. In this update, we extended the range of third-person weapon sounds, increased the range of first-person weapon impacts in the world, and generally balanced third-person footsteps and ability sounds.
HERO UPDATES
General
Updated visuals for all shields and barriers to increase readability
Enemies’ health bars will now become visible to players if an entity they create deals damage to an enemy (e.g. Symmetra’s turrets)
Brigitte
Barrier Shield
Shield health reduced from 600 to 500
Developer Comments: The health of Brigitte’s barrier was extremely difficult for most heroes to deal with, especially as she closes the distance to her targets. This change still provides Brigitte with substantial survivability but should also be more rewarding for opponents who pressure her.
Doomfist
Hand Cannon
Damage falloff now starts at 15 meters
Developer Comments: Doomfist is all about getting up close and personal with his enemies, but his Hand Cannon's spread was tight enough to do surprising amounts of damage at longer ranges, especially against bigger targets. This change brings his weapon in line with other shotgun-style weapons by making its damage fall off beyond 15 meters.
McCree
Combat Roll
Cooldown reduced from 8 to 6 seconds
Developer Comments: Previously, McCree’s Combat Roll cooldown felt too restrictive, which sometimes prohibited players from using it. The new, faster cooldown allows for more flexibility when choosing between using it for mobility or an instant reload.
Pharah
Concussive Blast
Cooldown reduced from 12 to 9 seconds
Rocket Launcher
Attack speed increased
Lowered recovery time between shots from 0.9 to 0.75 seconds
Damage redistributed between explosion and impact
Explosion damage reduced from 80 to 65
Impact damage increased from 40 to 55
Explosion knock back reduced by 20%
Self-knockback amount increased by 25%
Developer Comments: We wanted to increase how responsive Pharah’s Rocket Launcher felt, because a full second of recovery between shots made it feel sluggish. To balance out the improved recovery time, we shifted some damage from the rocket's explosion to the direct impact damage. The overall damage potential is now increased when landing direct hits and decreased slightly when only dealing explosive damage. We reduced the amount of knockback each explosion causes, as it made it very difficult to aim at Pharah with rockets coming in at a faster pace. The Concussive Blast cooldown reduction should allow the ability to sync up more closely with the Jump Jet cooldown when used for mobility.
Mei
General
Updated visual effects for all abilities
Orisa
Fusion Driver
Maximum spread reduced by 20%
Developer Comments: Orisa spends a significant amount of time firing her Fusion Driver from a relatively stationary location. The weapon's spread value caused it to feel too random when leading targets at a distance, considering the projectiles' travel time. We’ve tightened the spread slightly, which should leave her close- and mid-range damage potential largely unchanged, while making it feel better when hitting targets at longer ranges.
Soldier: 76
Heavy Pulse Rifle
Number of shots until reaching maximum spread increased from 6 to 9
Developer Comments: Soldier: 76’s damage output was a bit low, but not too far off from where we felt it should be. Making it take a few more shots to reach max spread smooths out the weapon spread curve and should make his damage more consistent.
Torbjörn
General
Reduced the size of Torbjörn’s head hit volume by 10%
Rivet Gun
Primary Fire
Projectile speed increased from 60 to 70 per second
Reload time reduced from 2.2 to 2 seconds
Turret targets enemy hit by primary fire
Alternate Fire
Recovery lowered from 0.8 to 0.6 seconds
Damage per shot lowered from 150 to 125
Reload time reduced from 2.2 to 2 seconds
Spread randomization readjusted
Forge Hammer
Radius increased to align with Quick Melee
Deploy Turret
Turret is now a thrown projectile
Automatically builds over three seconds
No longer has different levels
Same damage output as previous level 2 turret
Maximum health reduced from 300 to 250
Now incurs a 5 second cooldown when deployed
Now incurs a 10 second cooldown when destroyed in combat
No longer able to deploy a new turret if it’s in combat
While the turret is firing
If the turret has taken damage within three seconds
Can now be destroyed using the Interact input
Completes self-building once deployed, even if Torbjörn is eliminated
New Ability: Overload
Replaces Armor Pack
Lasts for 5 seconds
Cooldown is 12 seconds
Temporarily grants 150 armor
Increases attack, movement, and reload speeds by 30%
New Ultimate: Molten Core
Switches weapon from Rivet Gun to his claw arm
Lasts 6 seconds
Fire up to 10 molten globules that create damage pools where they land for 10 seconds
Globules bounce off walls and ceilings until they hit the ground
Base damage is 130
Damage increases from 130 to 190 against enemies who have armor
Heroes affected by armor: Bastion, Brigitte, D.Va, Orisa, Reinhardt, Torbjörn, Winston, Wrecking Ball
Heroes who can grant armor to their allies: Brigitte
Developer Comments: Torbjörn was initially designed to be a specialized hero, intended to be a strong defensive option due to his armor-generating capabilities and ability to control areas with his turret. However, the scrap collecting and Armor Pack mechanics have proven to cause problematic gameplay issues because of their feast or famine nature. To make him more flexible in a wide variety of situations, we’ve removed the scrap system, made the turret much easier to deploy, replaced the Armor Pack ability with Overload—a powerful self-buff—and transformed Molten Core into a powerful new area denial ultimate ability.
Please note that Torbjörn will be unavailable in Competitive Play for two weeks.

GENERAL UPDATES
General
Added visual outlines to make allies visible through walls
HERO UPDATES
General
Fixed a bug that would cause some weapons that fired multiple shots at once to inconsistently deal critical damage (e.g. Doomfist’s Hand Cannon, D.Va’s Fusion Cannons, Genji’s Shurikens, Reaper’s Hellfire Shotguns, Roadhog’s Scrap Gun, and Torbjörn’s Rivet Gun)
Developer Comments: While this is a bug fix, we wanted to highlight this change as it can affect gameplay by changing the damage output of the affected heroes in certain situations. After this fix, weapons with spread should now correctly calculate critical damage for each individual pellet that lands in a critical region (e.g. a headshot). The end result of this change is that it should be significantly easier to deal critical damage with any weapon that fires multiple shots simultaneously, such as Reaper’s Hellfire Shotguns and D.Va’s Fusion Cannons. In addition, we’ve changed the logic for when these weapons display a critical marker on your screen. It now requires 30% of your shots to be critical, rather than displaying it if a single pellet hits critically.
Ana
Biotic Rifle
Increased the precision of the Relative Aim Sensitivity While Zoomed slider. This can be found under Options > Controls > Hero > Ana
Brigitte
Shield Bash
Now knocks down and gets knocked down by other charging targets (e.g Reinhardt and Doomfist)
Developer Comments: Currently, when two charging targets hit each other, they both fall down and are briefly stunned. You can see this interaction with Doomfist’s Rocket Punch and Reinhardt’s Charge abilities. Brigitte’s Shield Bash previously wasn’t included in this group, which meant that if she used Shield Bash against these other abilities, she would generally stun them and not be affected herself. This change makes it so if she uses Shield Bash against Charge or Rocket Punch, both players will be knocked down.
Reinhardt
Earthshatter
Now consistently hits enemies near walls
No longer hits enemies that enter the damage cone after the “wave” has passed that area
No longer damages enemies behind barriers blocking it, even if the barrier is later dropped or destroyed
Always travels up inclines and around the payload
Developer Comments: We’ve given Earthshatter a complete overhaul to combat inconsistencies with its performance. These changes will make Earthshatter’s behavior more predictable and effective.
Roadhog
Scrap Gun
Primary fire falloff range changed from 10-20 meters to 15-30 meters
Alternate fire now has damage falloff, which is the same as the new primary fire falloff (15-30 meters)
Developer Comments: Previously, Roadhog’s Scrap Gun alternate fire didn’t have damage falloff which sometimes made it too powerful against far away targets. To balance out a slight power decrease, especially against barriers, we decided to push his overall weapon’s effective range out bit further before damage falloff begins to take effect. Note: The alternate fire falloff begins from where the scrap projectiles are formed, not from Roadhog’s firing position.
Widowmaker
Grappling Hook
Now retains momentum when used on environments or structures without a ledge (e.g. walls)
Widow's Kiss
Increased the precision of the Relative Aim Sensitivity While Zoomed slider. This can be found under Options > Controls > Hero > Widowmaker

GENERAL UPDATES
General
Changed the name of Junkrat’s Buccaneer skin to Bilgerat
Added under attack voice lines for Zenyatta, Lúcio, and Moria
All Overwatch League skins now include the name of the team’s city or state
Looking for Group
Settings will be saved after changing filters on the Looking for Group browse screen
Hero Gallery
Added a What’s New option that displays new unlockable content
HERO UPDATES
General
Some ultimate abilities now restore ammunition after completion for some heroes
Abilities affected: Genji’s Dragonblade, Junkrat’s RIP-Tire, Pharah’s Barrage, Roadhog’s Whole Hog, and Zenyatta’s Transcendence, Winston’s Primal Rage
Developer Comments:The change removes the need to immediately reload after a long duration ultimate.
Ana
Nano Boost
Now also instantly heals the target for 300 health
Range increased from 30 to 40 meters
Developer Comments: These changes help Ana’s Nano Boost be usable in more situations. Previously it was almost entirely used to combo with other allies’ ultimates, just before they use them. With this change Nano Boost can now alternatively be used to save an ally from near death in the middle of a big fight.
Brigitte
Shield Bash
Cooldown increased from 6 to 7 seconds
Repair Pack
An option to control Brigitte’s Repair Pack targeting sensitivity has been added under Options > Controls > Brigitte
Developer Comments: Brigitte’s Shield Bash is one of her strongest abilities, and its short cooldown can make it difficult to play against. Slightly increasing its cooldown will give her opponents more opportunity to play around it. We’ve also added an option to control Brigitte’s Repair Pack targeting sensitivity which will allow players to reduce the width of the search angle for the ability. This is useful for trying to target specific allies in the middle of a fight at the cost of making it a bit harder to target allies in general.
Doomfist
Rocket Punch
No longer impacts Symmetra’s teleporter
Now destroys Symmetra’s sentry turrets without stopping his movement
Developer Comments: These changes are just quality of life improvements for how Doomfist interacts with Symmetra’s placed objects.
Hanzo
Lunge
Cooldown increased from 4 to 5 seconds
Developer Comments: Hanzo’s Lunge ability allows him to be a bit too evasive, so we’re increasing the cooldown to make him easier to catch.
Lúcio
Crossfade
Aura radius increase from 10 to 12 meters
Sound Barrier
Temporary shields granted increased from 500 to 750
Developer Comments: Increasing the amount of shield health gained from Lúcio’s Sound Barrier should make it more effective against incoming burst damage. As part of his last rework, Crossfade’s radius was heavily reduced, but its potency was increased to compensate. While the change was better for him overall, the radius was small enough that it was often difficult to keep his allies in range during a fight, even if they felt reasonably close together. The increased radius should help in these situations.
Mercy
Caduceus Staff
Healing beam reduced from 60 healing per second to 50 healing per second
Developer Comments: Mercy’s previous healing output made her nearly irreplaceable in any team composition. Even after this change she will still be able to deliver more healing over the course of a match than any other support hero, but it should allow for other healers to be more viable.
Moira
Biotic Grasp
Passive energy regeneration rate increased from 2 per second to 2.4 per second
Developer Comments: This change should help Moira in situations where there are no enemies within reach but your team still requires a lot of healing. She will still need to drain enemies to be fully effective, but this just helps her a bit in the rare cases where there is an extended long-range fight that she can’t reasonably take part in.
Reinhardt
Barrier Field
Decorative insignia no longer protrudes from the shield’s surface
Developer Comments: By smoothing out Reinhardt’s Barrier Field, he now will be able to consistently block enemy abilities and projectiles that could sometimes unintentionally sneak through (e.g. Junkrat’s grenades).
Sombra
General
Reduced the size of Sombra’s head hit volume
Developer Comments: The head changes are mostly a bug fix, as her head hit volume was abnormally large, especially from behind. Previously if you fired at her from behind near her upper spine, you could land a head shot. Now her head volume is much more accurate.
Symmetra
Photon Projector
Primary fire range increased from 10 to 12
Developer Comments: Symmetra’s primary fire has huge damage potential but it is too difficult to charge because of its low range and slow charge rate. We’re increasing the range to see how it plays out, giving her more opportunities to use it, especially against enemy barriers.
Widowmaker
Grappling Hook
Cooldown increased from 8 seconds to 10 seconds
Developer Comments: The increased cooldown will slightly reduce the frequency that Widowmaker can reposition herself. This allows her to be threatened more easily by agile enemy heroes such as Winston and Genji.
Zarya
Energy
Drain rate reduced from 2 energy per second to 1.6 energy per second
Graviton Surge
Radius reduced from 8 to 6 meters
Developer Comments: The smaller radius on Graviton Surge makes it more reasonable for her enemies to try countering it by staying spread out, as well as putting more focus on Zarya to position the ultimate correctly to impact the most players possible. However, the intent of these changes isn’t to lessen Zarya’s overall power significantly so we’re reducing her energy drain rate, which should keep her energy higher on average resulting in more damage and quicker ultimate charge times. Overall, this takes some power out of her ultimate and distributes it else ware to add more counter play against her.
GAME BROWSER AND CUSTOM GAMES
Heroes
Brigitte’s Repair Pack now has a minimum cooldown time of 1.5 seconds regardless of custom game settings
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed a bug that displayed an inaccurate AFK countdown timer before removing players from a match if they were flagged as AFK more than once

Lúcio
Fixed a bug that allowed Lúcio to gain ultimate charge while Sound Barrier was active if he got hacked
Orisa

Reinhardt
Fixed a bug that prevented cracks from appearing on Reinhardt’s Overwatch League Away skins when his Barrier Field takes damage

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Seasonal Event: Overwatch Anniversary 2018
Celebrate Overwatch’s two-year anniversary with a new FFA (free-for-all) Deathmatch map—Petra—and more than 190 Anniversary items (60+ new for 2018), including eight legendary skins: Stealth Bastion, Shieldmaiden Brigitte, Formal Doomfist, Buccaneer Junkrat, Sherlock McCree, Forest Spirit Orisa, Magician Symmetra, and Cybjörn Torbjörn. Did you miss an item from a previous event? Throughout Overwatch Anniversary, you’ll be able to unlock items from past seasonal events with credits (and opening Anniversary Loot Boxes)!
Many of our past seasonal brawls will be available to play in the Arcade, and the brawl of the day will rotate throughout the event.
As a bonus this year, each Anniversary Loot Box can contain items from past seasonal events! You’ll also get one Legendary Anniversary Loot Box, with at least one guaranteed legendary item, just for logging in to the game during the event.
Thank you all so much for spending the last two years playing Overwatch with us, and we look forward to celebrating with you in-game!
New Map: Petra
A group of archaeologists have begun an excavation and preservation project among the ruins of Petra, a new FFA (free-for-all) Deathmatch map that puts all heroes on their own, facing off against one another until one hero scores enough eliminations to win the match.
Take in Petra’s majestic views, from high vistas to twisting passageways and deep caverns. Travel along deadly cliffs, but be careful to not fall off! A dilapidated bridge stretches across the map, and the ground underneath it can crumble away into a lethal pit (with a little firepower). Hopping on a green jump pad will boost you up to Petra’s higher levels and unlock new strategic possibilities for you. . . .
New Competitive Play mode: FFA Deathmatch
Petra and Château Guillard will also be available in an optional Competitive FFA Deathmatch mode with placement matches, skill rating, leaderboards, and the opportunity to earn competitive points.
HERO UPDATES
Developer Comments These changes should help Ana when she is trying to land clutch heals in the middle of a big fight. Allies that do not need healing will no longer block shots meant for allies that do. Increasing her magazine size makes it less likely to be forced into a reload in the middle of an important fight.
Projectiles will now pass through allies with full health
Ammo increased from 10 to 14
Developer Comments Brigitte’s ultimate is very powerful, especially when it is placed on the entire team. This change will reduce the maximum armor value of Rally, but does not reduce the overall amount of armor given by the ability over its duration. This means when used in combat while her allies are taking damage, it should feel about the same, but the lingering effects of the armor should have less of an impact. Her Shield Bash is a very strong ability on a fairly short cooldown, making it difficult for her opponents to play around. Increasing this cooldown allows for more options when battling against her.
Maximum armor per player reduced from 150 to 100
Cooldown increased from 5 to 6 seconds
Developer Comments Hanzo’s Storm Arrows are doing too much damage considering his other changes, such as Lunge and projectile speed. This damage reduction will give Hanzo’s enemies a more reasonable chance to react and fight against him while using Storm Arrows.
Damage reduced from 80 to 70
COMPETITIVE PLAY UPDATES

Rialto is now available in Competitive Play
GAME BROWSER AND CUSTOM GAMES

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Hero: Wrecking Ball (Tank):
Wrecking Ball’s tinkering capabilities and iron-clad mech make him a formidable tank hero, capable of bowling through the front line of the opposition and causing mayhem in the back line. His primary weapon, Quad Cannons, are two sets of twin machine guns that shred enemies caught in their crosshairs. No team is too much for Wrecking Ball to engage against with his Adaptive Shield, which generates more health based on the number of enemies nearby. This shield makes him incredibly difficult to kill when he bulldozes into the fray and, once he starts to get low on health, also provides him the endurance to escape. The Roll ability allows Wrecking Ball to withdraw the mech’s robotic limbs, transforming it into a ball with increased movement speed. No obstacle can stand in Wrecking Ball’s way when he uses Grappling Claw, a short-range ability that grips the environment, letting him swing across terrain gaps or around corners to smash enemies. Grappling Claw also allows Wrecking Ball to reach top speed and ram into foes, dealing destructive damage and knocking them back. While airborne, the mech’s Piledriver ability causes Wrecking Ball to slam down from the air and knock his enemies off their feet.
When Wrecking Ball is at his strongest, he can use Minefield which flings mines onto the ground that deal a considerable amount of damage to enemies unfortunate enough to trigger them.

As with all new heroes, please note that Wrecking Ball's release in Competitive Play will be delayed by two weeks.
GENERAL UPDATES
General
Added a note to Sombra’s Hero Information page about her ability to remove her own Translocator
Removed the Shield Generators Destroyed statistic from players’ Career Profiles
Looking for Group
Added a button that allows you to queue into the selected game mode once the group becomes full
Added a button to relist groups in the LFG browser when the group has empty role slots
HERO UPDATES
General
Several heroes have received major changes to their damage falloff:
Bastion
Configuration: Sentry and Configuration: Recon - Minimum damage at max range increased from 30% to 50%.
McCree
Peacekeeper - Minimum damage at max range increased from 30% to 50%
Mei
Endothermic Blaster - Removed all damage falloff from her secondary fire projectile
Soldier: 76
Heavy Pulse Rifle - Minimum damage at max range increased from 30% to 50%
Widowmaker
Widow's Kiss - Now has damage falloff applied on her automatic primary fire (50% at max range)
Developer Comments:The goal of these changes is to slightly reduce the impact of damage falloff on mid-range weapons. While assessing falloff mechanics across the board, weapons intended primarily for close-range combat benefited too greatly from lowering their falloff restrictions. We also normalized a couple of outliers in that Mei had a long-range travel time projectile with falloff applied and Widowmaker's automatic fire did not have any.
Hanzo
Storm Arrows
Duration reduced from 6 to 5 seconds
Cooldown increased from 8 to 10 seconds
Developer Comments: Hanzo’s new kit has proven to be a bit too powerful, especially his new Storm Arrows ability. We’re lowering the frequency that he can have this ability available to make it more reasonable to play around.
Sombra
Stealth
Now lasts indefinitely
No longer can contest objectives while invisible
Movement speed buff decreased from +70% to +50%
Translocator
Now lasts indefinitely
Can now be destroyed (has 5 health)
Radius reduced
Developer Comments: These changes allow Sombra to more easily play as an infiltrator and scout for her team, as well as give her time to pick and choose when to reveal herself to ambush her enemies.
MAP UPDATES
General
When final objectives on non-control maps are contested for extended amounts of time and attackers have an advantage in numbers, the respawn time for defenders now increases even faster
Developer Comments: In a previous patch we added a system to adjust the respawn rate of defenders in situations where attackers have a prolonged advantage in fights on final objectives. We’re just making this system a bit more aggressive to further reduce the duration of the long, drawn out fights that can occur when the defender spawns are so close to the action.
Assault Maps
Objective time reduced from 5 minutes to 4 minutes per control point in Quick Play and Arcade modes
Developer Comments: We have reduced the overall game time for Assault maps in Quickplay and Arcade Modes. Players now have four minutes to capture each point instead of the current five minutes per point. In some games, Point A would be captured rather quickly resulting in what could be lengthy battle over Point B. Point B is typically more defendable than Point A and, in some games, defenders were able to hold for the entire duration of remaining time which could potentially be 8 minutes or more. We felt that in these instances the overall time was simply too long for either team, with attackers unable to take the point and defenders having to hold. The reduction in time is now consistent with the Competitive Play times which provides an ample amount of time for both attackers and defenders, but hopefully removes the occasional game where it feels like you are playing against the timer and not the other team.

PATCH INTRODUCTION
We’re super excited about this patch because we are adding some social features that we hope you guys really like!
First, our Endorsement system. Endorsements give you a way to acknowledge other players for having a positive impact on your gaming experience. We have ways to report people for poor conduct, but now, if you have teammates who coordinated well, a leader who gave great direction, or even someone who was just being positive you can now let them know how much you appreciated it with an endorsement!
Second is Looking for Group. A long-awaited feature that we’ve being dying to get in the game. Looking for group allows you to find like-minded players before you queue to make sure you have the kind of Overwatch experience you want! Things like specifying what game mode want to play, preferring voice chat, and knowing that a player wants to play a certain role before you go into battle together goes a long way toward solid hero compositions and team work. One small tip: Once you have created a LFG group you can browse the list and search for groups that meet your needs and invite them to join up! This is a more proactive approach to getting a group together faster.
We can’t wait for you guys to start using these systems!
—Jeremy Craig, Principal Game Designer

Acknowledge your fellow Overwatch players’ positivity with endorsements! Recognize commendable behavior for players exhibiting sportsmanship, being a good teammate, or for shot calling. Commend players who lead you to victory, put the team’s needs above their own, or exhibit humility in victory or grace in defeat. Endorsements are readily available to view on Career Profiles, the Groups menu, and more so you can tell at a glance the types of players you’re playing with. Those who consistently maintain a high endorsement level will receive periodic rewards, while those who display negative behavior or accrue suspensions will lose their endorsements.
Looking for Group
Play your way using the Looking for Group feature! You can control your gameplay experience before stepping into a match by using specific parameters to create your dream team. Join a team of other like-minded players or lead a group of your own by creating a group with your personal preferences such as game mode, role enforcement, and more. Those who want to queue up for Quick Play, Play vs AI, or any competitive mode can set the types of roles others can play. These specifications will then be activated in-game (e.g. players who chose a support role will be restricted to only using heroes in that category).
GENERAL UPDATES
General
All heroes in the Defense and Offense categories have been merged into a new category: Damage
Developer Comments: Since the line between Offense and Defense heroes has become increasingly blurred, we’ve decided to group all those heroes into a single new “Damage” category. We believe that the term more closely matches the role name that is now being used in Overwatch League and across most of the game’s community.
Combat can now be heard 25% further away
Changed the name of the Varok spray to Saurfang
Players must have Blizzard SMS Protect enabled on their account to be eligible for the Top 500
The Acknowledge and Interact buttons are now separate input bindings
Career Profile
Added an Inspire Uptime Percentage statistic for Brigitte on the Career Profile
Removed some statistics for Symmetra on the Career Profile
Added a Scoped Critical Hit Accuracy statistic for Widowmaker on the Career Profile
Career Profiles will no longer be public by default (now defaults to Friends Only). An option to make Career Profiles visible has been added under Options > Social > Profile Visibility
ARCADE UPDATES
General
Symmetra can now be played in 1v1 duel game modes (e.g. 1v1 Limited Duel and 1v1 Mystery Duel)
HERO UPDATES
Doomfist
Meteor Strike
Bonus movement speed increased from 150% to 200%
The Best Defense…
Shield gain increased from 30 to 35 for normal abilities
Developer Comments: The increased movement speed on Meteor Strike gives Doomfist new options in how and where to deploy it. His passive is also being increased, allowing him to survive more often when diving into enemies.
McCree
Deadeye
Range increased from 70 meters to 200 meters
Developer Comments: While McCree’s Deadeye rarely came into play at 70 meters, we are increasing the range so it cannot be a limiting factor during normal gameplay.
Orisa
Supercharger
Ultimate cost reduced by 15%
Developer Comments: Supercharger wasn’t getting enough use, considering its impact. This change allows Orisa to use her ultimate more aggressively, knowing that she will be able to generate them more easily.
Symmetra
Photon Projector
No longer locks onto targets
Range increased to 10 meters
Damage ramping now takes 2 seconds per damage level instead of 1 second
Damage ramp increased from 30/60/120 to 60/120/180
Now generates ammo instead of spending it when hitting a barrier
Ammo reduced from 100 to 70
Alternate Fire
No longer locks onto targets
No longer pierces targets
Now explodes on contact
Projectile speed increased
Charge up speed increased
Damage changed to 60 impact / 60 explosive
Sentry Turret
Turret is now placed like a projectile instead of being set in place
Can hold a max of 3, down from 6
Can now deploy a max 3, down from 6
Damage increased
Amount of slowing effect increased
Teleporter
Can now place the exit up to 25 meters away from Symmetra
Entrance will automatically be built in front of Symmetra, rather than at her team’s spawn point
Lasts 10 seconds
Health lowered to 300
More things can teleport through it (e.g. Junkrat’s RIP-Tire)
Entrance can be destroyed
If either the entrance or exit is destroyed, the other is removed
New Ultimate: Photon Barrier
Deploys a barrier that is big enough to span and cut through an entire map
Orientation can be changed by pressing the ultimate button again
Lasts 15 seconds
Has 5000 health
Developer Comments: The goal of these changes is to move Symmetra to her new damage role and make her more flexible and viable across more areas of the game than she was previously. Now that Symmetra is no longer a support hero, she is expected to be able to dish out heavy damage, and these changes allow for her to do so. She should be more powerful and interesting in more team compositions and maps, and she should also be stronger on offense and defense.
MAP UPDATES
Horizon Lunar Colony
Point A
Added a staircase on the right when exiting the Hydroponics Room
Removed the door to the lower room on the right
Removed the small wall on the catwalk above Point A
Added some cover walls to the catwalk area
Moved the door next to the staircase that led to Winston’s room
The door is now on the side of the wall in the training pit
Moved the large health pack to the back of the room
Removed some clutter in the upper left computer room
Hydroponics Room
Switched the positions of the large and small health pack
Changed some of the hydroponic plant cover on the right
Point B
Defender spawn room exits moved from the front to the sides out of direct line of fire
Small rooms added at spawn room exits
Additional cover added near the spawn room exits
Added a route and larger platform leading to the back right corner
Raised the platform to the same height as the attackers’ platform on the opposite side of the point
The location of the old defender exit is now an alcove with a small health pack
Both teams can still pass behind the point, but there is now a cut-through in the middle of the wall for better access
The area above the window overlooking the point is now covered
A large platform with cover has been attached to the left side of the catwalk
The upper platform for the attackers has been reduced
The doorway leading to the platform is slightly smaller
Developer Comments: We’ve wanted to make some gameplay improvements to Horizon Lunar Colony for some time now. The defenders’ spawn room had a problem with its main exit that allowed defenders to quickly duck back inside and regain health while attackers shot at them without doing damage. Since we were already reworking the entire back area, we decided to make some more changes addressing player feedback. The idea behind the rework of Point A was to not only help the defenders a bit, but also provide some gameplay options aside from sitting on the point and trying to hold it for as long as possible. Easier access to high ground, as well as limiting the routes for attackers (or at least allowing for defenders to more easily spot the attackers), will allow more opportunity for counters and create a better gameplay experience.
We’ve made a lot of additions and changes to the art throughout the map for you to discover as well.

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Seasonal Event: Overwatch Anniversary 2018
Celebrate Overwatch’s two-year anniversary with a new FFA (free-for-all) Deathmatch map—Petra—and more than 190 Anniversary items (60+ new for 2018), including eight legendary skins: Stealth Bastion, Shieldmaiden Brigitte, Formal Doomfist, Buccaneer Junkrat, Sherlock McCree, Forest Spirit Orisa, Magician Symmetra, and Cybjörn Torbjörn. Did you miss an item from a previous event? Throughout Overwatch Anniversary, you’ll be able to unlock items from past seasonal events with credits (and opening Anniversary Loot Boxes)!
Many of our past seasonal brawls will be available to play in the Arcade, and the brawl of the day will rotate throughout the event.
As a bonus this year, each Anniversary Loot Box can contain items from past seasonal events! You’ll also get one Legendary Anniversary Loot Box, with at least one guaranteed legendary item, just for logging in to the game during the event.
Thank you all so much for spending the last two years playing Overwatch with us, and we look forward to celebrating with you in-game!
New Map: Petra
A group of archaeologists have begun an excavation and preservation project among the ruins of Petra, a new FFA (free-for-all) Deathmatch map that puts all heroes on their own, facing off against one another until one hero scores enough eliminations to win the match. Take in Petra’s majestic views, from high vistas to twisting passageways and deep caverns. Travel along deadly cliffs, but be careful to not fall off! A dilapidated bridge stretches across the map, and the ground underneath it can crumble away into a lethal pit (with a little firepower). Hopping on a green jump pad will boost you up to Petra’s higher levels and unlock new strategic possibilities for you. . . .
New Competitive Play Mode: FFA Deathmatch
Petra and Château Guillard will also be available in an optional Competitive FFA Deathmatch mode with placement matches, skill rating, leaderboards, and the opportunity to earn competitive points.
HERO UPDATES
Ana
Biotic Rifle
Projectiles will now pass through allies with full health
Ammo increased from 10 to 14
Developer Comments: These changes should help Ana when she is trying to land clutch heals in the middle of a big fight. Allies that do not need healing will no longer potentially block shots meant for teammates that do need it. Increasing her magazine size makes it less likely that Ana will be forced into a reloading in the middle of an important fight.
Brigitte
Rally
Maximum armor per player reduced from 150 to 100
Shield Bash
Cooldown increased from 5 to 6 seconds
Developer Comments: Brigitte’s ultimate is very powerful, especially when it is placed on the entire team. This change will reduce the maximum armor value of Rally, but does not reduce the overall amount of armor given by the ability over its duration. This means when used in combat while her allies are taking damage, it should feel about the same, but the lingering effects of the armor should have less of an impact. Her Shield Bash is a very strong ability on a fairly short cooldown, making it difficult for her opponents to play around. Increasing this cooldown allows for more options when battling against her.
Hanzo
Storm Arrows
Damage reduced from 80 to 70
Developer Comments: Hanzo’s Storm Arrows are doing too much damage considering his other changes, such as Lunge and projectile speed. This damage reduction will give Hanzo’s enemies a more reasonable chance to react and fight against him while using Storm Arrows.
COMPETITIVE PLAY UPDATES
Rialto
Rialto is now available in Competitive Play
GAME BROWSER AND CUSTOM GAMES
General
Added Infinite Ultimate Duration and Scalable Ultimate Duration options for Moira’s Coalescence

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Escort Map: Rialto
Rialto was home to Talon agent Antonio Bartalotti’s sprawling estate and the backdrop to the infamous “Venice Incident,” a turning point for Overwatch and Talon. The Italian government has taken great steps to preserve Venice, and the results are striking. Tourists visiting this picturesque town can sample the regional cuisine, enjoy a relaxing gondola ride, visit Galleria D’arte Omnica, or simply take in the sights with a stroll along the canal.
NOTE: Rialto will not be available in the Competitive Play rotation until a future patch.
HERO UPDATES
Brigitte
Shield Bash
Cone angle reduced from 90 to 60
Developer Comments: When fighting against Brigitte, it often felt like Shield Bash was able to hit players who felt like they were out of its range and should have dodged it. On the flip side, when playing as Brigitte sometimes players would hit the wrong enemy in the middle of a fight. With the cone being reduced, the ability is more accurate to its visual representation.
Genji
Deflect
Hitbox size has been reduced
Developer Comments: The hitbox on Genji’s Deflect was big enough that it would sometimes reflect projectiles that were pretty far away from him. We’ve tightened up the hitbox, which should solve this problem while still fully protecting him from projectiles that would hit him from the front.
Hanzo
Storm Bow
Projectile speed increased from 85 to 100
Sonic Arrow
Cooldown decreased from 20 seconds to 12 seconds
Duration decreased from 10 seconds to 6 seconds
Radius decreased from 10 meters to 7 meters
New Abilities
Lunge
Press jump while in the air to leap horizontally
Storm Arrows
Replaces his existing Scatter Arrow ability
Hanzo can now rapidly fire up to 6 arrows that deal reduced damage but are always fired at full power
Developer Comments: The goal of these Hanzo changes is to allow him to have new options and maintain his high damage output, while removing the frustration of fighting against the old Scatter Arrow. Hanzo is now much more mobile with his new Lunge ability, and with the combination of the bow projectile speed increase and the new Storm Arrows ability he can now deal his high damage more consistently than ever before.
Junkrat
Frag Launcher
Projectile size decreased from 0.3 to 0.2
RIP-Tire
Tire movement speed decreased from 13 to 12
Developer Comments: These changes are aimed at lowering some of the most frustrating parts about playing against Junkrat. Decreasing the Frag Launcher’s projectile size means he will have to aim a bit more carefully to land powerful direct hits and slowing the RIP-Tire’s movement speed gives his opponents slightly more time to destroy it before it detonates.
Lúcio
Wall Ride
Wall riding is less likely to be interrupted along a single surface
Can now go around corners (both outside corners, and inside corners) without having to leave the wall
Can now land back on the same wall after leaping away, provided his leap takes him far enough away from the original jumping off point
Added a minimum time that the jump key must be held before Lúcio can ride around corners
Soundwave
No longer consumes ammo
Can now be used while reloading
Developer Comments: Wall Ride has been significantly overhauled to allow it to function more smoothly across more areas of every map. Lúcio players should instantly notice a huge improvement in where and how Wall Ride can be used. In addition, Sonic Amplifier’s Soundwave ability was unnecessarily controlled by both a cooldown and an ammo cost, so we’re removing the ammo cost.
Tracer
Pulse Bomb
Max damage decreased from 400 to 300
Developer Comments: Pulse Bomb was too good at killing tanks, who can be easy to stick due to their size. This damage reduction makes it less powerful as a tank-destroyer, while keeping it lethal against most other heroes.
GAME BROWSER AND CUSTOM GAMES
General
Mercy’s Regeneration (passive ability) can now be turned off in Custom Game settings
Settings for Hanzo’s Lunge and Storm Arrow abilities can now be found in the Custom Game settings

GENERAL UPDATES
General
Players can choose to “Avoid as Teammate” with a dropdown menu in the Career Profile
Developer Comments: The addition of the “Avoid as Teammate” option gives players the ability to craft their online gameplay experience. Up to two players can be selected with this feature. If you use the “Avoid as Teammate” option on a player, the matchmaker will no longer place you on a team with the avoided player for one week. To learn more about this feature, click here.
Report Menu
The “Poor Teamwork” dropdown menu option has been removed
The “Griefing” dropdown menu option has been renamed “Gameplay Sabotage”
Developer Comments: Due to player confusion about the most appropriate category to report players for poor or toxic gameplay, we are removing the Poor Teamwork option from the reporting system. Players should instead use the Gameplay Sabotage option when players actively harass or disrupt their own team with game mechanics or their actions. Players should not be reported simply for performing poorly, since everyone occasionally has a bad game.
Heroes
Sombra’s “Enemies Hacked” commendation card now also displays her offensive assists
Brigitte’s Golden Weapon variant will now also give her a golden shield
Changed Mercy’s Valkyrie voice line
HERO UPDATES
Brigitte
Barrier Shield
An option to “Toggle Barrier” has been added under Options > Controls > Brigitte
D.Va
Micro Missiles
Explosive damage reduced from 6 to 4
Boosters
Impact damage reduced from 25 to 10
Developer Comments: D.Va’s burst potential is a bit too high, so we’re reducing the damage of her Micro Missiles and Boosters impact. Prior to this change, each missile dealt 3 impact damage and 6 explosive damage. We’re reducing explosive damage from 6 to 4 but leaving the impact damage the same, the net result being 21% damage reduction.
McCree
Added additional voice lines for Lifeguard McCree
Mei
Endothermic Blaster
Now pierces through enemies
Developer Comments: This change helps Mei combat multiple targets that are clumped up and makes it easier for her to keep freezing a specific target if another enemy gets in the way. This change also helps her ultimate more consistently freeze enemy targets, especially if they are near each other. Note: While her shots now pierce enemies, they still do not pierce barriers such as Reinhardt’s shield.
Reaper
Death Blossom
Reloads Hellfire Shotguns after use
Wraith Form
Move speed bonus increased from 25% to 50%
You can now cancel the ability by pressing the Shift or Primary Fire hotkey
Developer Comments: These changes help Reaper use Wraith Form more consistently as an escape, but they also open up new options, such as chasing down key targets.
Moira
Biotic Grasp
Transparency increased the closer you are to a target
Coalescence
Now becomes more transparent the closer its visual effects are to a player’s camera
Fade
Transparency increased the closer you are to a target
Developer Comments: Due to issues with visibility, we have made most of Moira’s visual effects fade away the closer they are to the camera. We have also made modifications to Coalescence to greatly increase the ability for foes and allies alike to see through it when facing it.
Zenyatta
Orb of Destruction
Secondary fire rate of fire reduced by 15%
Developer Comments: Zenyatta is meant to be able to deal a lot of damage, especially for a support, but his alternate fire burst damage was a bit too high. This change keeps the overall damage the same but lowers the DPS slightly and makes it harder to hit multiple shots at very long ranges.
BUG FIXES

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Hero: Brigitte (Support):
An engineer with peerless armor-constructing abilities, Brigitte Lindholm is a valiant squire who fights on the front line to protect her allies.
Brigitte’s armor engineering capabilities make her a stalwart support hero, capable of holding her ground in combat while also providing healing and armor for her teammates. Her primary weapon is her heavy-hitting Rocket Flail that she swings in a wide arc in front of her to smash multiple enemies at once. Whip Shot enables Brigitte to fling her flail forward, striking enemies at a distance and knocking them backward. With each blow, Brigitte’s passive ability, Inspire, heals nearby allies over time.
Brigitte’s Barrier Shield deploys a frontal energy barrier that can absorb a limited amount of damage and protect any allies directly behind her. Once her Barrier Shield is deployed, she can use Shield Bash to lunge forward and stun the first enemy in her path. Drawing on her engineering prowess, Brigitte can create Repair Packs to instantly heal wounded allies or provide armor to teammates at maximum health. When Brigitte is at her strongest, she can activate her ultimate ability, Rally—a galvanizing call to arms that generates a substantial amount of armor for nearby allies and increases Brigitte’s movement speed so she can lead them into battle.

Brigitte will be available in Competitive Play in Season 10. To learn more, click here.
GENERAL UPDATES
General
Changed the name of Junkrat’s Scarecrow spray to Hayseed
Updated Mercy’s Toast victory pose
HERO UPDATES
Sombra
Hack
Now goes on a 2-second cooldown when interrupted by damage
Now more consistently interrupted when targets break line of sight
Developer Comments: Developer Comments: We’re also removing the 0.1 second window of time during a hack where it couldn’t be canceled via line of sight or with other abilities including Tracer’s Recall and Zarya’s Particle Barrier, which was originally put in place so the hack wouldn’t be interrupted by small objects such as light posts. We’ve implemented a separate fix for that issue, so she should still be unaffected by those small objects.
USER INTERFACE UPDATES
General
The Team Information Screen now displays the ultimate charge of your teammates
BUG FIXES

Fixed a bug that caused Doomfist’s Rocket Punch cooldown to delay counting down if he was in a movement hindering ability (e.g. Zarya’s Graviton Surge or Junkrat’s Steel Trap)
Fixed a bug that prevented Doomfist’s Rocket Punch from hitting enemies that were close to him
Fixed a bug that prevented Junkrat’s RIP-Tire kills from being credited in the Kill Feed if the targets had a long death animation (e.g. D.Va’s Mech)
Fixed a bug that caused Mercy’s Regeneration to occur instantly if she took damage while at full health

HERO UPDATES
Doomfist
Hand Cannon
Ammo recovery rate increased from 0.8 seconds to 0.65 seconds per bullet
Developer Comments: This change will help Doomfist more consistently be able to use his weapon as part of his combos.
Mei
Endothermic Blaster
Freeze (slow) duration increased from 1 second to 1.5 seconds
Weapon alternate fire ammo cost reduced from 25 to 20
Developer Comment: Increasing Mei’s slow duration helps her freeze targets that are particularly elusive such as Genji or Lúcio. Lowering her alternate fire ammo cost allows her to more safely use it without costing her the ability to freeze enemies.
Sombra
EMP
No longer blocked by small objects (e.g. sign posts)
Hack
No longer gains ultimate charge from health pack healing
Cast time reduced from 0.8 seconds to 0.65 seconds
Now disables the following abilities:
Genji—Cyber-agility
Hanzo—Wall Climb
Pharah—Hover Jets
Lúcio—Healing Boost and Speed Boost (turns off current song entirely), Wall Ride
Mercy—Angelic Descent
Machine Pistol
Machine Pistol spread reduced from 3 to 2.7
Opportunist
Enemy health bars are now visible when health drops below 100% (formerly 50%)
Her ability to detect enemies through walls at 50% or less remains unchanged
Translocator
Duration increased from 15 seconds to 20 seconds
Developer Comment: The goal of these changes for Sombra is to remove the necessity for her teammates to take damage and heal themselves with her hacked heath packs to try to get her ultimate charged up quickly. Her ultimate will now come up less often, but there are more abilities that are disabled by Hack so it is more effective when used. Previously, Opportunist would only activate when an enemy’s health bar dipped below 50% but now the passive will reveal all damaged enemies which should help Sombra identify targets in her line of sight to pick off. Overall these changes should make her more effective and less reliant on her ultimate.
MAP UPDATES
Blizzard World
Some health pack sizes have been reduced
Some health pack locations have been changed
Additional health packs have been added
Developer Comments: Health packs are a valuable resource in Overwatch and positioning around them is key to holding ground on defense or keeping up momentum on offense. We have moved the location of some health packs and included additional ones to improve game play on Blizzard World.
USER INTERFACE UPDATES
Mercy
Valkyrie
No longer shows enemies’ health bars unless they have taken damage
Developer Comment: This helps remove some clutter from Mercy players’ screens when they use her ultimate
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed a bug that prevented Capture the Flag statistics from displaying on the Career Profile if the match was played on Ayuttheya in the Arcade

HERO UPDATES
Lúcio
Wall Ride
Activating Wall Ride will now cause the flag to drop during Capture the Flag matches
Developer Comments:Lúcio’s Wall Ride allowed him to reach unintended places in Capture the Flag maps, which made it overly difficult for opponents to stop him. So, we have changed the ability to cause the flag to drop instead for better balanced matches.
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed a typo that caused the Lunar New Year banner to display the wrong end date for Overwatch Lunar New Year
Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the client to crash after a player used the Hero Skin Selection dropdown menu in Hero Select

Hero Skin Selection
Fashion-forward heroes, rejoice! Players can now change hero skins with the “Select Skin” dropdown menu in the Hero Select screen at the start of a match. Show off your favorite unlocked skins when playing solo or coordinate with your friends to be the best dressed on the battlegrounds of tomorrow.
HERO UPDATES
Doomfist
Hand Cannon
Damage reduced from 11 to 6
Number of bullets fired increased from 6 to 11
Spread pattern made more consistent
Developer Comments: We have made a lot of progress with Doomfist’s movement in recent patches but we wanted to revisit his Hand Cannon. While the damage per bullet has been lowered, the number of bullets he fires per Hand Cannon shot has been increased which makes his overall damage output unchanged. Overall, these changes will help his Hand Cannon feel much more consistent.

HERO UPDATES
Junkrat
Concussion Mine
Now will deal less damage to targets farther away from the explosion’s center
Developer Comments: Junkrat has been enjoying the flexibility his double-charge Concussion Mine provides, but it has become a bit too easy to throw out huge bursts of damage in a large area. With this change he can still dish out similar damage but he must now be more accurate with his tosses.
Mercy
Valkyrie
No longer makes Resurrect instant
No longer grants a bonus Resurrect charge
The speed bonus Guardian Angel receives when activating Valkyrie has been decreased by 50%
Duration reduced from 20 seconds to 15 seconds
Developer Comments: Mercy’s recent Resurrect changes have helped in allowing enemies to have more counter play in dealing with her, but she was able to use Resurrect through Valkyrie enough to largely mitigate the impact of the previous changes. Additionally, we’re toning back the amount of mobility Valkyrie provides through Guardian Angel and reducing its duration to overall reduce the power of this ability.
BUG FIXES
Heroes
Fixed a bug that prevented D.Va’s face and hair textures from loading when her Black Cat skin was equipped

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Hero: Moira (Support):
Wielding both regenerative and degenerative technologies at her fingertips, Moira O’Deorain is Talon’s ambitious geneticist who seeks the knowledge to rewrite the building blocks of human life by any means necessary.
Moira’s cutting-edge capabilities make her a mobile healer and damage dealer capable of adapting to any situation. Her main attack is Biotic Grasp, which she can use to either heal allies or sap an enemy’s life force. Biotic Grasp’s primary fire sprays a cone of energy that heals all teammates within range, draining biotic energy while active, which will replenish slowly over time. Her alternate fire is a beam that tethers to enemies, dealing damage and siphoning health. Draining her foes’ health regenerates Moira’s biotic energy even faster, allowing more healing for her allies.
Her Biotic Orb ability launches a sphere of energy that bounces around the battlefield, healing nearby allies or damaging enemies until it dissipates. Fade enables Moira to disappear out of sight and sprint through the shadows, and makes her invulnerable for its duration. When Moira’s ultimate is ready to be unleashed, she can cast Coalescence—a powerful, long-range beam of chaotic energy that pierces through barriers to heal allies or damage enemies in its path.
To learn more about Moira, click here.
As with all new heroes, please note that Moira’s release in Competitive Play will be delayed by one week.
GENERAL UPDATES
General
Clicking the "leave game as group" checkbox will now remember your selection for future matches
Arcade
One of the arcade slots will now change on a daily basis to include a variety of game modes such as Limited Duel, Low Gravity, and Capture the Flag
HERO UPDATES
Ana
Biotic Rifle
Damage increased from 60 to 70
Developer Comments: Ana has been outshined by other support heroes lately. Boosting her damage will help her defend herself and make her more threatening to the enemy team.
Lúcio
Lúcio now has an effect above his head to indicate which song he's playing in spectator mode
Mercy
Caduceus Staff
Increased visual readability of Mercy's healing and damage boosting beams
Resurrect
Cast time increased from 0 seconds to 1.75 seconds
Mercy's movement speed is now reduced by 75% while casting
Can now be interrupted when Mercy is knocked back, stunned, or hacked
Valkyrie
While active, Resurrect no longer has a cast time
While active, casting Resurrect does not reduce Mercy's movement speed
Developer Comment: We feel that Mercy’s recent rework has been successful, but her Resurrect ability still feels too strong and frustrating to play against. Now that it has a cast time, enemies are more able to counter the ability. However, Resurrect will cast instantly when Valkyrie is active. This should make her feel powerful when she transforms on the battlefield.
Winston
Barrier Projector
Now displays a health bar
Developer Comment: This change will help both Winston's allies and enemies know how much more damage his shield can absorb from oncoming attacks.
COMPETITIVE PLAY
General
Grandmaster players can now only group up with other players within 250 Skill Rating
Developer Comment: We have tightened the Skill Rating range that Grandmaster players can group up with from 500 SR down to 250 SR. This is to ensure our highest ranked players are playing with equally skilled people, which should lead to more satisfying games.

GENERAL UPDATES
Social
Players can now set their social status to Online, Away, Busy, or Appear Offline (Note: appearing offline does not prevent friends from seeing you if you are placed into the same match). This option can be found under the social menu
HERO UPDATES
Lúcio
Wall Ride
The speed boost that Lúcio receives after completing a wall ride has been increased by 65%
Developer Comments: A recent bug fix slowed Lúcio’s Wall Ride. This change compensates for the reduced speed.
Mercy
Guardian Angel
Players can now glide past a targeted ally using the jump key
Cooldown no longer resets when Resurrect is activated
Valkyrie
No longer resets or reduces Resurrection’s cooldown
Now gives players a bonus resurrection charge
Developer Comment: Valkyrie no longer resets or reduces Resurrect’s cooldown. Instead, it now provides an extra 'charge,' allowing you to revive an ally even if it is still on cooldown. If the bonus charge hasn’t been spent when Valkyrie ends, it will be removed.
This method makes Resurrect more flexible when used with Valkyrie. For example, in the past if you wanted to resurrect two teammates, you had to revive the first target, then activate Valkyrie (causing the Resurrect’s cooldown to reset), and then revive the other target. With this change, you can now activate Valkyrie and fly in quickly to resurrect both targets instantly.
However, this still reduces the overall number of Resurrects that Mercy can provide, since Valkyrie no longer reduces its cooldown.
Zenyatta
Added a number of additional voicelines for Cultist Zenyatta
BUG FIXES
Heroes
Fixed a bug preventing Mercy’s momentum from slowing down correctly when Guardian Angel was canceled
Fixed a bug preventing the visual effects on Sombra’s Pumpkinette victory pose from displaying correctly

GENERAL UPDATES
Overwatch Halloween Terror Victory Pose Updates
We've made a few changes to this year's selection of seasonal victory poses. To learn more about this change, click here.
HERO UPDATES
General
Ultimate charge is now immediately expended when a hero's ultimate ability is activated, instead of depleting over a short period of time
Developer Comments: One of the most common pieces of feedback we receive revolves around the way Overwatch handles ultimate interruptions. Players often feel frustrated when they’re able to prevent an enemy from using an ultimate, only to see that same enemy use it again immediately after respawning
Until now, many ultimates drained the meter quickly over time, instead of instantly setting the meter to zero when the button was pressed. We originally designed it this way to ensure that players had the chance to use (at the very least) a little of their ultimate every time. However, we now feel that it causes too much frustration without adding many benefits.
With this patch, ultimate abilities will instantly set a hero’s meter to zero when the button is pressed, which means stopping an enemy ultimate at any point after it’s activated will ensure that it has been spent.
Another piece of feedback we often hear is that it’s difficult to understand which abilities are interruptible and which are not. For clarity, most of Overwatch’s ultimates fall into three basic categories:
Transformation Ultimates:
These add significant passive benefits to your heroes, while allowing the use of weapons and abilities.
Ultimates in this category: Bastion's Configuration: Tank, Genji's Dragonblade, Mercy's Valkyrie, Soldier: 76's Tactical Visor, Torbjörn's Molten Core, and Widowmaker's Infra-Sight.
Channeled Ultimates: These force your hero into a new mode and render your other abilities unusable while active. In most cases, these abilities can be interrupted at any point to cancel them.
Ultimates in this category: Doomfist’s Meteor Strike, McCree's Deadeye, Pharah’s Barrage, Reaper’s Death Blossom, Roadhog’s Whole Hog, and Zenyatta's Transcendence (though, Zenyatta’s ultimate renders him immune to interruptions).
Cast-Time Ultimates: These abilities require a small window of time to pass before they become effective. If they’re interrupted during this window, they are canceled.
Ultimates in this category: Ana's Nano Boost, D.Va’s Call Mech and Self-Destruct, Hanzo's Dragonstrike, Junkrat's Rip-Tire, Lúcio’s Sound Barrier, Mei's Blizzard, Orisa's Supercharger, Reinhardt's Earthshatter, Sombra's EMP, Symmetra's Shield Generator and Teleporter, Tracer's Pulse Bomb, and Zarya's Graviton Surge.
Most abilities fit neatly within these categories but we did make some changes to outliers such as Genji's Dragonblade and Orisa's Supercharger to make them more consistent. Additionally, any ultimate that can be interrupted by a stun (Channeled ultimates and Cast-Time ultimates) can now be interrupted by Sombra’s Hack as well. Overall these changes should make it much easier to understand the ultimate mechanics and how they interact in combat.
D.Va
Boosters
An option to manually hold down D.Va’s boosters rather than toggling them has been added under Options > Controls > D.Va
Genji
Dragonblade
No longer interrupted when Genji is stunned or hacked
Developer Comments: See the above developer comment on ultimate interruptions
Orisa
Supercharger
Can now be interrupted when Orisa is stunned or hacked
Developer Comments: See the above developer comment on ultimate interruptions
Sombra
Hack
Now interrupts the following ultimate abilities during their cast time: Ana's Nano Boost, Orisa's Supercharger, Mei's Blizzard, Reinhardt's Earthshatter, and D.Va's Call Mech
Developer Comments: See the above developer comment on ultimate interruptions
USER INTERFACE UPDATES
Assault Maps
When capturing an objective, the progress bar is now broken into three segments that will fill in with the team’s color that is capturing it (as each segment fills, it will trigger an animation and audio cue)

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Escort Map: Junkertown
Junkertown is located in the harsh and unforgiving Australian Outback. Constructed from the remains of a destroyed omnium, it's now the home to a band of lawless scavengers known as the Junkers, led by their cutthroat Queen. When they aren’t pillaging the omnium's skeleton for anything of value, the Junkers blow off steam in the Scrapyard—a massive gladiatorial arena whose combatants fight for glory, riches... and to survive.
GENERAL
General
Mystery Heroes
Players will no longer see the Assemble Your Team screen at the beginning of a game
Players who purposefully kill themselves will no longer respawn as a new hero. However, their Ultimate ability will reset and anything that’s been placed (i.e. Torbjörn’s turret) will despawn
Players will no longer be respawned as the same hero
These changes also apply to any custom games where the “Respawn as Random Hero” option has been enabled.
User Interface Updates
The skull icons that indicate where teammates were killed throughout the map have been replaced with hero portrait icons
Third person camera view will now frame the action automatically when spectating or waiting to respawn
HERO UPDATES
D.Va
Micro Missiles (New Ability)
D.Va fires a barrage of small rockets that detonate on impact, dealing damage in a limited radius around each explosion. These can be fired while D.Va is using any other ability or firing her Fusion Cannons
Defense Matrix
Defense Matrix's resource meter will now deplete twice as quickly
Energy regeneration per second has been increased to 12.5% (formerly 10%)
Boosters
Fusion Cannons can now be fired while flying
Developer Comment: D.Va’s Defense Matrix uptime has proven to be too strong, but simply reducing it without making other changes would make her too weak (and far less interesting to play). Instead, we’re adding a new ability and giving her the ability to fire while flying. These changes give D.Va new options while maintaining Defense Matrix’s ability to shut down big enemy attacks.
Mercy
Resurrect (formerly Mercy’s Ultimate ability)
Ability now targets a single player, instead of every player within a radius
Radius reduced to 5 meters
Ability cooldown is 30 seconds
Mercy is no longer granted invulnerability while Resurrect is active
Valkyrie (New Ultimate Ability)
Valkyrie unleashes the full power of Mercy’s Valkyrie suit, enhancing her weapons and abilities for 20 seconds
Caduceus Staff: Mercy’s healing and damage boost beams now affect all allies near the targeted teammate, and the staff’s effective range has been extended
Caduceus Blaster: Now has infinite ammo and increased projectile speed
Guardian Angel: Increased range and movement speed
Resurrect: Cooldown is instantly reset when Valkyrie is activated and reduced to 10s after the initial cast
Hover: Mercy gains the ability to fly freely, at increased movement speed
Regeneration (Passive): No longer interrupted when Mercy takes damage
Developer Comment: While resurrecting downed allies is a core part of Mercy’s gameplay, the way her Ultimate functioned was causing a number of problems. It was frustrating to play against, and it incentivized Mercy players to hide away from important battles, instead of taking part in them. This version turns Resurrect into a single target ability. It’s still an important part of Mercy’s kit, but plays much better for both Mercy players and her enemies. Valkyrie, her new Ultimate, gives her the opportunity for big game-making plays and opens a number of new options for her.
Reinhardt
Barrier Field
Holding primary fire while your shield is active now allows you to rotate the camera
Developer Comment: This change gives Reinhardt more situational awareness while using his shield, allowing him to keep an eye on the battlefield while still protecting his team.
A new “Movement Relative to Camera During Barrier Free Look” option can be found under Settings > Controls. Simply select “Reinhardt” from the dropdown menu. This allows players to change the way Reinhardt moves when Barrier Shield is active and players are controlling the third-person camera movement
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed a bug that caused Custom Reticles to appear transparent and ignore opacity settings when their thickness was set to 1
Fixed a bug that caused Control matches to be played in a best-of-five format when creating a custom game using the Competitive preset
Fixed a bug that prevented players from requesting a highlight while viewing a killcam after being killed
Fixed a bug that prevented voice lines from playing after players received five votes on a commendation card at the end of a match
Fixed an issue that prevented players from automatically joining Match Chat, even when the option was enabled
Fixed a bug that prevented players from receiving the Perfect Round indicator after an Elimination game if they received a temporary health boost from an ability (e.g. Lúcio’s Sound Barrier)
Fixed a bug that caused the “Aim Ease In” setting to affect controller input too aggressively when the thumbstick was deflected diagonally
Deathmatch
Fixed an issue that prevented the entire Team Deathmatch description from being displayed in the info section
Fixed a bug that occasionally caused the incorrect announcer VO to play in highlights captured during Deathmatch games
Fixed a bug that allowed Junkrat to destroy his own Steel Traps with Concussion Mines
Heroes
Fixed a bug that occasionally caused the heroes’ “sigh” voice line to play when respawning
Fixed a bug that interrupted the animation on Ana’s eye during the Beach Ball emote with her Captain Amari skin equipped
Fixed a bug that prevented Doomfist from being knocked back when his Rocket Punch ability was being used
Fixed a bug that allowed Doomfist’s Rocket Punch to hit players through the taxi on King’s Row
Fixed a bug that caused a pair of pink fuzzy dice to mysteriously float onto the screen when viewing D.Va’s weapon in the Hero Gallery if her Cruiser skin was equipped
Fixed an issue that caused the golden tint of Junkrat’s weapon to appear dull when his Firework skin was equipped
Fixed a bug that gave Junkrat’s RIP-Tire a speed boost when players wall jumped on ledges
Fixed a bug that occasionally caused Mei’s Ice Wall to launch players into the air
Fixed a bug that caused Mei’s Ultimate to appear friendly (it failed to change from blue to red) after being reflected by Genji
Fixed a bug that prevented Roadhog’s Chain Hook icon from being displayed in the kill feed when it caused an environmental kill
Fixed a bug that caused Symmetra’s Photon Barrier to indicate a 10-second cooldown when the red “cannot use” icon was active
Using D.Va's melee attack no longer cancels Micro Missile barrage
D.Va's Micro Missiles are now interrupted by stuns, knockbacks, and other crowd-control effects
Mercy’s Resurrect is no longer blocked by Steel Trap or Graviton Surge
Mercy is no longer able to use Valkyrie to escape Graviton Surge and Steel Traps
Maps
Fixed a bug on Ecopoint: Antarctica that could cause a crate to block your view of heroes during the winning team lineup
Fixed a bug that allowed Reaper to reach unintended locations on Castillo
Fixed a bug that allowed some heroes to reach unintended locations on Horizon Lunar Colony
Fixed a bug that prevented reflections from appearing on weapons while standing in certain areas on Ilios

Fixed a lighting issue that caused some items on the last point of Route 66 to take on a pinkish hue when players used low video settings
Fixed an issue that caused reflections to appear overly dark while players were standing in areas of the Cave Inn on Route 66
Fixed an issue that caused excessive camera zoom and flashing lights when players loaded into the tutorial map
Fixed a bug that prevented plated railings from being properly destroyed by weapons fire on Volskaya Industries

User Interface
Removed the “Healing Prevented” statistic from Ana’s career profile page
Fixed a bug that caused Doomfist’s Rocket Punch UI to occasionally remain visible when respawning
Fixed a bug that prevented Doomfist’s Seismic Slam from accurately targeting moving objects, causing Doomfist to land in unintended locations

Patch Highlights
New Game Modes: Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch
Two new game modes have been added to the Arcade: Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch!
In Deathmatch, eight players go head-to-head until one player scores 20 points. Players will earn 1 point whenever they land the final blow on an opponent and will lose 1 point whenever they die to environmental damage (ex: falling off a cliff) or self-inflicted damage. This scoring will be tracked in a brand-new scoreboard. The first player to 20 points wins!
In Team Deathmatch, two teams of four players face off until one team scores 30 points. Players will earn 1 point for their team whenever they land the final blow on an opponent and will lose 1 point for their team whenever they die to environmental damage (ex: falling off a cliff) or self-inflicted damage. If players are resurrected before they respawn, the corresponding point for their death will be deducted from the enemy team’s score. This scoring will be tracked in our default scoreboard. The first team to 30 points wins!
Both modes will play out on a selection of maps from our existing pool:
Hanamura
Horizon Lunar Colony
Temple of Anubis
Volskaya Industries
Dorado
Eichenwalde
Hollywood
King’s Row
(TDM only) Black Forest
(TDM only) Castillo
(TDM only) Ecopoint: Antarctica
(TDM only) Necropolis
We’ve made several modifications to many of these maps (including restricting play to a specific area and developing a special respawn system) when playing in these modes. We’re also introducing a brand-new map specifically for Deathmatch: Château Guillard! Learn more about this map below.
Both modes will be available for play in Custom Games. Watch our developer update for additional insight: https://youtu.be/4_CBzklel1c
New Deathmatch Map: Château Guillard
Château Guillard is located near Annecy in southeastern France. For hundreds of years, it was the estate of the influential Guillard family, until it gradually fell into disrepair after the family's power waned in the decades after the Revolution. Recently, the château has found a new owner: the Talon agent Widowmaker, who has returned to her family's ancestral home.
General
General
A number of data format changes have been implemented
Developer Comments: Over the past few months, we’ve been working on a number of significant under-the-hood changes that will help us streamline the patching process. This will allow us to reduce the download size in future patches, but it does mean that today’s patch is larger than a traditional patch.
Match-wide voice chat has been added for Deathmatch and Custom Games
An “Aim Ease in” option has been added under the “Advanced” tab in the “Controller” menu. This allows players to customize their turn rate acceleration. If you’d like to know more, check out the developer explain over on the forums.
Hero Updates
Junkrat
Concussion Mine
Junkrat can now hold two mines
RIP-Tire
Tire’s movement speed has been increased by 30%
There is no longer a time limit when wall climbing
Developer Comments: Giving the Junkrat the ability to store two concussion mines adds some much-needed flexibility and versatility to his kit, particularly when using the mines for mobility. RIP-Tire’s damage has always been very good, but it was often difficult to steer the tire into position before it was destroyed. Increasing its speed will allow players to effectively detonate the tire more often and decrease the amount of time that Junkrat is vulnerable while controlling it.
Orisa
Fusion Driver
Projectile speed increased by 20%
Protective Barrier
Barrier size increase by 20%
Barrier shape has been changed to allow for more coverage from enemies that are below the barrier
Developer Comments: The projectile speed increase helps Orisa’s consistency, especially at medium ranges (or further). Her barrier size has been increased to better protect her team, and the new shape makes the shield more effective when it’s used on slopes or on top of objects (such as a payload).
Roadhog
Take a Breather
Can now be used while moving
Damage taken while healing has been reduced by 50%
Developer Comments: These changes help Roadhog be much more aggressive when looking for hook targets or blocking for his team. The combination of these effects significantly increases Roadhog’s sustainability and survivability.
Widowmaker
Grappling Hook
Cooldown has been reduced from 12 seconds to 8
Venom Mine
Affected targets are now visible through walls (to you as Widowmaker only)
Developer Comments: Widowmaker is extremely powerful in the right hands, but her abilities often felt a little weak. The Grappling Hook cooldown reduction means she is more likely to have it available when she needs to escape. Venom Mine is intended to be an early warning system, uncovering enemies that are attempting to flank her or her team. With this change, she can see enemies when they trigger the mine, even if they’re on the other side of a wall.
Competitive Play
General
The length of Competitive Play seasons has been reduced to 2 months (formerly 3)
The winner on Control maps will now be decided based on a best-2-out-of-3 series (formerly 3-out-of-5)
Due to the shortened season length, fewer Competitive Points will be rewarded at the end of each season
More Competitive Points will be rewarded for wins or ties in Competitive Play
15 Competitive Points for a win (formerly 10)
5 Competitive Points for a tie (formerly 3)
Periodic Skill Rating decay has been reduced
Previously inactive players (in Diamond tier or above) lost 50 Skill Rating per day. This has been reduced to 25 Skill Rating per day
Playing a match now increases the time till decay by 36 hours (up from 24 hours). The maximum number of days remains set at 7
Players who place in Diamond or below can now lose their place in that tier if their Skill Rating drops below the minimum requirement. However, they’ll still earn their end-of-season rewards for their highest skill tier placed
Player Skill Ratings will no longer be temporarily lowered at the beginning of a season (after placement matches)
Changes in Skill Rating that occur after each competitive match have been adjusted to address some anomalies, especially with certain heroes
Developer Comments: Learn more about Skill Rating and Skill Tier updates in our forum post here.
Gameplay
Defensive spawn times will now slowly increase earlier in the battle when the attacking team has more players on the objective
User Interface
General
Added an “Outline Opacity” option under the custom reticle settings (found under Controls > Options > Advanced), which allows players to control the opacity of the black outline surrounding the reticule
Bug Fixes

Fixed a bug that was preventing Doomfist’s Rocket Punch from connecting with enemy players that were moving up an incline
Fixed a bug preventing Orisa’s “Overclocked” achievement from being granted, even after the criteria was met
Fixed a bug causing Sombra’s teeth to be visible while her Stealth ability was active when her Los Muertos skin was equipped
Fixed a bug causing Sombra’s reload animation to play even when interrupted
Maps
Fixed a bug that allowed players to reach unintended locations on Ecopoint: Antarctica
Fixed a bug that allowed players to see past the map’s background on Black Forest
Fixed a bug that allowed players to reach unintended locations on Black Forest
Fixed a bug that caused the announcer to say “Travelling to Dorado” when joining Castillo
Fixed a bug that prevented some equipment (vents, pipes, etc.) from properly connecting to the walls of the power plant on Dorado
Fixed a bug that allowed players to reach unintended locations on Hanamura
Fixed a bug that caused some projectiles to go through the ground on the last point of Horizon Lunar Colony
Fixed an issue that caused sprays to display incorrectly on the crane on the Horizon Lunar Colony
Fixed a bug that caused pink lighting to appear in some areas of Ilios
Fixed a bug that could cause A.I. heroes to get themselves stuck while traveling to the Well Capture Point on Ilios
Fixed a bug that allowed players to reach unintended locations on Ilios
Fixed an issue that caused the lighting to appear dark in Genji’s room on Nepal
Fixed a bug that allowed players to reach unintended locations on Oasis
Fixed a bug that prevented Pharah’s Jump Jet from recharging while perched on door frames in Oasis
Fixed a bug that prevented door frames from being visible and lacking collision on the Practice Range
Fixed a bug that caused some players to get stuck behind a plant near the second point on Route 66
Fixed a bug that allowed Doomfist to reach unintended locations on Volskaya Industries
User Interface
Fixed a bug in the Options > Controls menu that prevented the asterisk (which normally indicates that changes have been made) from being removed from the hero’s dropdown after controls have been set to default
Fixed a bug causing the Back button to disappear when scrolling through the list of available games in the Game Browser

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Hero: Doomfist (Offense):
Equipped with charisma and ambition, Doomfist is a consummate tactician and one of the leaders of Talon: literally throwing down his gauntlet as he joins the fight. From his base in Nigeria, Doomfist is a commanding offense hero equipped with hard-hitting melee abilities. Driven by a belief that conflict is essential to humanity’s progress, he’s committed to advancing his vision of the future—even if the agents of Overwatch disagree with his methods.
Doomfist’s cybernetics make him a highly mobile, powerful frontline fighter. His primary attack is the Hand Cannon; this four-shot weapon fires projectiles from Doomfist’s knuckles one at a time or in a single blast. With his secondary attack, Rocket Punch, he charges forward and delivers a devastating blow, knocking back any opponent it connects with and dealing extra damage if the enemy is hurled into a wall.
Seismic Slam smashes into a targeted area, knocking opponents toward him so he can deal further damage. His Rising Uppercut tosses enemies high into the air, while his passive ability, The Best Defense…, grants him shields every time he uses one of his abilities against an opponent. Lastly, his ultimate ability, Meteor Strike, causes him to leap high and drop into a targeted area, dealing massive amounts of damage.
To learn more about Doomfist, click here.
Loot Box Updates
We always want the experience of opening a loot box to feel exciting and rewarding, and in our latest patch, we’re working to improve that experience in two key ways. First, we’re drastically reducing the amount of duplicates you will receive when opening loot boxes. Second, to compensate for this reduction of duplicate items, we’re also increasing the overall amount of credits you will receive from loot boxes. On average, you should be earning just as many credits, if not slightly more, from loot boxes as you did prior to these changes.
New Highlight Options
Our highlights system has received several major updates:
The game will continue to automatically generate highlights for you based on your recent gameplay. These auto-generated highlights—now categorized as “Today’s Top 5”—will be surfaced on a daily basis and persist for a full 24 hours (or until the game client is patched, whichever happens first).
Players can now generate their own highlights! The ability to capture 12 seconds of your own gameplay has been added to the game, and can be bound to a single button of your choice (or a button per highlight slot) in the Options menu under “Request Highlight.” These player-generated highlights will be saved under a new section called “Recently Captured” and will persist until the game client is patched. Players can have up to 36 recently-captured highlights stored at one time.
With the above, players can now record any of their “Top 5” or “Recently Captured” highlights, exporting them as a video file to their gaming platform’s designated media library (on console) or directory (on PC). On PC, players will also have the option to select the quality at which these highlights are exported, supporting up to 4K for Windows 8 or higher operating systems, and up to 1080p on Windows 7.
To learn more about this feature, check out our recent developer update: https://youtu.be/OkYJlPMdWNA
GENERAL
Adjusted the respawn timing to limit defensive stalling strategies when the offensive team has a clear advantage and plays aggressively
Custom Games and Game Browser
Clarified the text on the “Flag Carrier” options under the Capture the Flag settings for Custom Games
Removed the “Projectile Speed” and “Projectile Gravity” options for heroes who do not have projectile weapons
Minimum movement speed has been changed to 50% (formerly 10%)
Players can no longer select Roadhog during Limited 1v1 matches
User Interface
Added ability to create customized reticles
Reticle options can be found under the “Controls” tab in the “Options” menu (click the “Advanced” expander under the “Reticle” heading)
The name of Mercy's “Stethoscope” spray has been changed to “Heartbeat”
Statistics gathered from 6v6 Elimination matches will now be added to statistics in the Career Profile
Tie games will no longer be included in the win percentage calculation that’s listed under the Player Profile
HERO UPDATES
D.Va
Defense Matrix
New sound effects and voice lines have been added, indicating when Defense Matrix has absorbed an enemy’s ultimate ability
Genji
Deflect
New sound effects and voice lines have been added, indicating when an enemy’s ultimate ability has been deflected
McCree
Flashbang
Stunned targets are now slowed heavily, meaning they're less likely to escape while stunned (especially while in the air)
Developer Comment: This change will make McCree's Flashbang consistent against fast-moving targets like Genji or Lúcio.
Reaper
Shadow Step
Sound effect and VO distance has been reduced by 50%
Developer Comment: Even though Shadow Step wasn't intended to be used as a way for players to teleport right next to an enemy without their knowledge, the sound effects were audible from distances that made teleportation difficult from nearly anywhere. This change allows Reaper to be a bit more sneaky with his flanking options.
Reinhardt
Rocket Hammer
Swing speed increased by 10%
Developer Comment: In the last update, Reinhardt’s Rocket Hammer had an issue that allowed players with higher latency to swing faster. We fixed this bug, which suddenly made the swing speed feel too slow, so we’re compensating by increasing his standard swing speed. During this process, we also found and fixed a few bugs with Rocket Hammer’s hit registration. Overall, the hammer should feel much better.
Zarya
Graviton Surge
Now disables mobility abilities on all affected targets
Developer Comment: In the past, the abilities that allowed heroes to escape Zarya’s Graviton Surge felt fairly arbitrary. We’re cleaning this up and increasing Graviton Surge's overall power by rendering all movement abilities unusable when an enemy is trapped.
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed an issue preventing “Best In Game” stats from being updated
Fixed a bug that could cause the user interface to incorrectly indicate that an enemy player has been hit when colliding with them
Fixed a bug that could allow projectiles that would normally pierce shields (i.e. Reinhardt’s Fire Strike) to pass through other surfaces
Fixed a bug that caused some players to lose audio during the match
Competitive Play
Fixed a bug that caused players to get a leaver penalty during offseason matches, even after the in-game banner advised it was safe to leave the match

Fixed a bug in Custom Game settings that prevented some heroes with Self Healing from having a Healing Dealt modifier
Removed the Projectile Gravity slider from heroes who do not have abilities affected by gravity

Fixed a bug with D.Va’s Call Mech ability that allowed you to see her inside the mech before entering it
Fixed a bug that could cause eliminations from Junkrat’s Total Mayhem to be mislabeled in the kill feed

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Assault Map: Horizon Lunar Colony
Built as a first step towards humanity's renewed exploration of space, the Horizon Lunar Colony’s goal was to examine the effects of prolonged extraterrestrial habitation—on human and ape alike. The scientists’ research proved incredibly promising...until, suddenly, all contact and communications with the base were lost.
New Legendary Skins
Oni Genji and Officer D.Va have been added to classic loot boxes
CUSTOM GAMES AND GAME BROWSER
Player gravity and projectile gravity can now be modified
Knockback magnitude can now be modified on any weapons or abilities that have a knockback effect
Jump height can now be modified
HERO UPDATES
McCree
Deadeye
Targets now begin locking on after 0.2 seconds, instead of 0.8 seconds
Damage accumulated over the first 1.0 seconds increased from 20 to 80 (damage per second after the first 1.0 seconds is unchanged)
Developer Comment: McCree’s ultimate can deal a lot of damage if it has a lot of time to build up, but it was often too difficult to get even a small amount of damage out before being stopped or killed. These changes make it more flexible and powerful.
Reaper
The Reaping (Passive)
Removed health orbs
Now regains 20% of all damage done to heroes as health
Developer Comment: Reaper’s old healing passive was useful if you could kill a bunch of enemies in a row. But since enemies needed to be dead for it to work, it wasn’t very helpful unless the situation was already in your favor. His new passive lets him get immediate benefit from it, especially when fighting Tank heroes, which tend to be larger targets that deal lower damage.
Roadhog
Head hitbox size reduced by 20%
Scrap Gun
Bullet damage decreased by 33%
Fire rate increased by 30%
Clip size increased from 4 to 5
Developer Comment: Roadhog’s head was abnormally large compared to similarly-sized characters, so we’re reducing its size to increase his survivability. The Scrap Gun changes reduce the power of his hook combo and alternate fire burst damage potential while still keeping his DPS roughly the same.
USER INTERFACE UPDATES
A quick summary of each player's most-played heroes is now available by highlighting the player in the Groups section of the Social menu (statistics displayed will dynamically change based on the mode/ruleset)
A new "All Modes" option has been added to the Career Profile that allows players to view combined stats from all game modes
A new "All Competitive Seasons" option has been added to the Career Profile that allows players to view combined stats from all Completive Play seasons
The “Damage Done” statistic has been replaced with “Hero Damage Done” in multiple locations
A new “Barrier Damage Done” statistic has been added to the Statistics section of the Career Profile, as well as an “All Damage Done” statistic, which combines damage done to barriers and heroes
Averages are now calculated in 10-minute slices, rather than by the number of games played
“Rate This Match” option no longer appears at the end of a match
Developer Comment: The new “Hero Damage Done” statistic is the same as the old “Damage Done” statistic, but it doesn’t include damage done to barriers, only damage against heroes and placed objects (e.g. Torbjörn’s turret). That number can be found in the new “Barrier Damage Done” or “All Damage Done” statistics. However, since “Hero Damage Done” and “Barrier Damage Done” are brand new, their averages will only be based on time played since they were added.
Also, the old statistics were calculated by taking total damage inflicted and dividing it by the number of games played. This resulted in an average that didn’t accurately reflect the underlying performance, because it didn't take into account the length of the games. The new averages are calculated in 10-minute slices.
BUG FIXES

Fixed a bug that allowed players to reach unintended locations on Temple of Anubis
Fixed a bug that allowed Sombra to reach unintended locations on Eichenwalde

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS:
New Seasonal Event: Overwatch Anniversary
We’re raising our glasses to toast the 30 million heroes who have answered the call to join us in Overwatch! From now until June 12, players can collect more than 100 Anniversary-themed rewards, and play three new Arena maps in the Arcade—all in celebration of our first year fighting for the future together. Put on your finest skins and join us for the festivities!
For more information, click here.
New Standard Loot Box Items
In addition to the new items in the Overwatch Anniversary event, we’re also adding new goodies to our standard loot boxes. Sombra, Orisa, and Tracer are all getting brand new emotes, and Reaper picks up several new unlocks based on the infamous shrug from the recent Uprising comic.
GENERAL
Custom Games and Game Browser
Added new rules sets for 3v3 and 1v1 Elimination modes on the Arena maps
Added options for Hero Lockout, Limited Hero Pool, Tiebreakers, and Hero Reveal for Elimination mode
Players can now disable secondary fire and secondary weapons in Custom Games
You can now disable one Symmetra ultimate while leaving the other active
HERO UPDATES
General
Recoil Recovery Aim Compensation can now be disabled for Ana, McCree, and Widowmaker. The option can be found under the “Control” tab in the “Options” menu. Simply select the appropriate hero under the dropdown menu and look for the “Hero” section
Developer Comments: By default, weapon recoil recovery is overruled by downward crosshair movement. This means that downward movement during the weapon’s recoil recovery phase will override the weapon’s natural recoil recovery. This option allows you to remove this functionality, meaning a weapon’s natural recoil recovery movement acts independently from downward crosshair movement. In practice, this will make your crosshair move faster if you aim downward during the recoil recovery window.
Genji
Removed the attack delay from Genji’s wall climbing ability, allowing him to engage with enemies immediately after he finishes climbing
Developer Comments: This is a quality of life change to make wall climbing feel better.
Hanzo
Removed the attack cooldown from Hanzo’s wall climbing ability, allowing him to engage with enemies immediately after he finishes climbing
Storm Bow
Increased charge speed by 10%
Charged arrows now maintain their charge after climbing a wall, provided the button is continuously held
Developer Comments: Decreasing Hanzo’s draw time gives him more overall DPS, while also letting him fully charge an arrow and more quickly return to full movement speed when needed. And, like the change to Genji’s wall climbing, this is a quality of life change that will make climbing feel better.
Orisa
Fusion Driver
Damage reduced by 9%
Protective Barrier
Cooldown reduced from 12 seconds to 8 seconds
Developer Comments: To help Orisa maintain the front line for her team, we’re reducing the cooldown of her Protective Barrier. This change also helps her reposition the barrier more easily when needed. To compensate for this new defensive strength, we're reducing her Fusion Driver's damage, as it felt too high.
Reaper
Wraith Form
Ammo is now entirely refilled when Wraith Form is used
Developer Comments: Wraith Form is typically used as an escape ability after firing. This change gives Reaper a fighting chance if an enemy chases him down as he uses it.
Reinhardt
Earthshatter
Effective height has been lowered from 3 meters to 2 meters
The height threshold of objects that Earthshatter can "climb" has been lowered from 3 meters to 2 meters, making Earthshatter less likely to climb tall objects as it moves along the ground.
Developer Comments: Earthshatter tended to climb unexpectedly high, frequently hitting targets that were significantly above the ground. These changes help the ability stay more grounded.
Soldier: 76
Heavy Pulse Rifle
Bullet damage decreased from 20 to 19
Developer Comments: Soldier: 76 is in a much better place lately, but his damage output was making him a must pick, compared to similar roles.
USER INTERFACE UPDATES
Your final blows are now highlighted by a white background in the Kill Feed
Added new Kill Feed icons for environmental kills and a number of abilities
Heroes resurrected by Mercy are now are now highlighted and color-coded in the Kill Feed
Certain types of assists, like McCree’s Flashbang or Zenyatta’s Orb of Discord, now show up in the Kill Feed
New Controller option: Force Keyboard/Mouse User Interface
Developer Comments: When PC players switch from using the Keyboard/Mouse to a game controller, the game’s user interface is dynamically updated to the console/controller version. Additionally, the button layout on many heroes (like Hanzo, Zenyatta, and Mercy) is different on console. In the past, when a player chose to play using a controller and a mouse, the UI would constantly switch, depending on which device was sending information to the game. This new option allows players to set a default user interface if they choose to use a controller along with a keyboard/mouse.
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed an issue that prevented voice lines from being heard during the Play of the Game
Fixed an issue causing shields to display the wrong team color during the Play of the Game
Fixed a bug that caused high resolution screenshot captures to have visual issues
Arcade
Fixed a bug causing the introduction before 1v1 Mystery Duels to be interrupted
Fixed an issue causing parties to be split between teams when joining a Custom Game as a group
Fixed an audio bug in Elimination games that could cause the end of round music to end abruptly
Fixed a bug in Custom games that caused parties to be evenly split between teams when they joined as a group
A.I.
Fixed a bug that allowed bots to become stuck around the well on Ilios
Custom Game Browser
A scroll bar has been added to the custom games settings window so players can see all changes if they extend below the screen
Disabling Primary Fire will no longer disable secondary weapons for Mercy, D.Va, and Torbjörn
Fixed a bug that prevented the cooldown modifier from functioning for Ana’s Sleep Dart
Fixed a bug that caused some weapons to stop playing sound effects when “No Ammunition Requirement” was used
Fixed a bug that caused parties to be split up between teams when joining a custom game
Competitive Play
Fixed an issue that could prevent the 30 and 60-second audio callouts from being played at the end of a match
Fixed a bug that prevented players from grouping based on skill rating restrictions during the off season
Heroes
Fixed a bug that caused Lúcio’s healing and speed song auras to be inaccurately projected
Fixed a bug that prevented Discord Orb from being removed when Mercy uses her Resurrect Ultimate
Fixed a bug that prevented Orisa’s Fortify from blocking the alternate fire from Lúcio’s Sonic Amplifier
Fixed a bug that prevented Roadhog's hook from pulling enemies into the reticle when the target was on higher ground
Fixed a bug that prevented Orisa’s Protective Barrier from deploying in certain situations
Fixed an issue that affected some graphics cards, causing an inaccurate ammo count to be displayed with Pharah’s Mechaqueen and Raptorion skins equipped
Fixed a bug that could prevent two charging Reinhardts from being able to kill each other
Fixed a bug that allowed Reinhardt to damage himself twice when charging a Fortified Orisa
Fixed a bug that prevented Winston’sPrimal Rage ultimate from restoring his health when hit by Ana’s Biotic Grenade
Maps
Fixed a bug that caused Tracer to move oddly when she first appeared in the tutorial
Fixed an issue causing asymmetry between pillars on the Ruins capture point on Ilios
Fixed a bug that allowed Sombra to reach unintended locations on Numbani
Fixed a bug that allowed players to reach an unintended location on Route 66
Fixed a bug that allowed Sombra to reach unintended locations on Watchpoint: Gibraltar

GENERAL
General
Added a slider for aim smoothing. This can be found under the “Controls” tab in the “Options menu. Click “Advanced” under the “Controller” heading
Developer Comments: By default, aim smoothing/acceleration is set to the same value that players are used to (full smoothing, low acceleration), but as you drag the slider toward 0, you'll experience less smoothing (higher acceleration). Once the value hits 0, smoothing will be entirely disabled (instant acceleration).
Players can now select a new Aim Technique: Linear Ramp. This can be found under the “Controls” tab in the “Options menu, along with the Dual-Zone and Exponential Ramp option. Click “Advanced” under the “Controller” heading
Developer Comments: This technique, along with disabled aim smoothing, will cause your crosshair to rotate proportionally with the angle that the stick is deflected. The effect is multiplied based on your sensitivity settings.
Competitive Play
On Assault and Assault/Escort Maps, teams now need to capture at least 33% of the objective before the tie-breaking system is activated
Developer Comments: When the new tie-breaking system was implemented on April 11, 2017, teams only needed to capture 1% to trigger the system. This occasionally resulted in confusing situations when games would end without a lot of information about how the point was captured, due to the brief capture time. To alleviate this problem, we’re requiring that teams progress past 33% before the tie-breaking system begins tracking progress. If neither team manages to cross 33%, the match will end in a draw. If you’d like to know more, click here.
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed a crash that could occur during the end-of-round screen
Arcade
Fixed a bug that prevented the payload from showing damage until after the escort phase in the Overwatch Uprising brawl
Fixed a bug that allowed players to get under the payload using certain heroes’ movement abilities in the Overwatch Uprising brawl
Fixed a bug that caused the payload’s health bar to interfere with the scoreboard, forcing players to hold down the spacebar to view the scoreboard in the Overwatch Uprising brawl
Fixed a bug that caused Genji’s “You’ve rescued me again, Dr. Ziegler” voice line to play after being resurrected in the Overwatch Uprising brawl, regardless of which hero performed the resurrection
Fixed an issue causing the chat window to block the ‘refresh’ button when the Overwatch Uprising leaderboards were open
Custom Games and Game Browser
Fixed a bug that prevented the ‘Start Game Mode’ button from appearing when creating a Capture the Flag or Elimination game
Heroes
Fixed a bug that gave Genji’s Dragonblade ability a slightly increased swing speed while at a higher latency. Dragonblade’s default swing speed has been slightly increased to compensate
Fixed a bug that prevented Genji’s Dragonblade ability from registering hits correctly
Fixed a bug to prevent hit effects from being inflicted on D.Va’s human form while piloting the mech
Maps
Fixed a bug causing glass that has been shattered by an explosion to be colored black

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Seasonal Event: Overwatch Uprising
Starting today, we’re rewinding the future, giving you the chance to relive the stories behind some of your favorite Overwatch heroes. Suit up with your friends and travel seven years into the past, joining Tracer on her very first mission in a brand-new cooperative brawl; or collect more than 100 declassified Loot Box items—including skins, highlight intros, emotes, sprays, and player icons!
For more information, click here.
GENERAL
General
Details about each hero’s unique backstory, along with information about some of their lore-inspired skins, have been added to the Hero Gallery
The Player Report system has been redesigned, adding new reporting options and activity examples to better capture the reason for each report
In-game voice conversations for the Overwatch Uprising event can now be displayed as subtitles. This can be enabled under the “Sound” tab in the “Options” menu
Competitive Play
A tracking system has been added to Assault and Assault/Escort Maps that will allow us to break ties based on the progress that was made toward capturing the objective.
Developer Comments: To mitigate draws in Competitive Play, we're implementing a system that tracks each team's progress on the objective. This will work similarly to the system that's already in place for Escort and Assault/Escort maps, which grants a win to the team that pushes the payload the furthest. Now, even if neither team successfully captures the objective, a winner can be determined based on which team captured the largest portion.
Custom Games and Game Browser
Custom Game settings can now be saved as a preset from the game’s details page. This can be accessed by right-clicking on the map image from the Create Game page, right-clicking a game name from inside the Game Browser, or via the save button on the settings page
Players can now change weapon clip and magazine size or grant unlimited ammunition when creating a custom game
Maps
A new route has been added to Eichenwalde that connects the attacking team's spawn area to the capture point
HERO UPDATES
Lúcio
Sonic Amplifier
Damage increased by 25%
Projectile speed increased from 40 to 50
Alternate fire now considers vertical orientation when knocking targets back
Crossfade
Area of effect radius has been decreased from 30 meters to 10 meters
Heal Song
Healing-per-second has been increased by 30% (also applies to Lúcio's Amp It Up ability)
Self-healing has been reduced by 25%
Wall Ride
Movement speed increased by 20% when wall riding
Lúcio now receives a burst of speed when leaping off a wall
Developer Comments: Lúcio has often felt like a must-pick due to his raw healing output and the versatility of providing a speed bonus to your entire team. The goal of these changes is to keep those elements feeling strong, but making them harder to apply to everyone on your team at all times. The end result is that he should feel stronger with teams that he can stay close to but not as strong when on teams with heroes that are often spread out (such as Pharah, Widow, Genji, etc). Much of Lúcio’s character power was tied up in his large passive auras, which caused other elements of his kit to be weakened over time in an attempt to balance him. Now that his auras are more focused it will allow them to be much stronger and allow Lúcio to be more active in his role.
Orisa
The size of Orisa’s head hitbox has been decreased by 15%
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed an issue preventing voice lines from being played on Control maps
Competitive Play
Fixed an issue that was preventing Top 500 icons from appearing until after completing a competitive match
Fixed a bug preventing achievements from being unlocked during off-season competitive matches
Fixed a bug that forced Play of the Game highlights to be drawn from the last round of play
Custom Games and Game Browser
Fixed an issue allowing empty player slots to be displayed even when disabled (e.g. in 6v1 games)
Fixed a bug preventing the pause feature from working properly after the original host has left the match
Fixed a bug that allowed extremely long team names
Removed unnecessary customization options (e.g. cooldown options for abilities with no cooldown)
Heroes
Ana no longer cocks her rifle after throwing a grenade
The brightness on Bastion's golden gun has been toned down when the BlizzCon skin is equipped
Fixed a bug causing Mei's pinky to bend awkwardly in some poses when her Chang'e and Luna skins were equipped
Maps
Fixed a bug on Eichenwalde that allowed enemy player outlines to be seen through a pile of dirt at the castle gate
Fixed an issue on Eichenwalde that allowed players to become trapped in the broken castle doors
Fixed a bug that allowed Sombra to reach unintended locations on King's Row
Fixed a bug that allowed players to reach unintended areas on the Capture the Flag version of Lijiang Tower
Fixed a bug that allowed Symmetra to hide turrets in unintended locations on Oasis

Orisa’s movement now slows slightly while firing in midair
Developer Comments: Much like D.Va’s Fusion Cannons, Orisa’s Fusion Driver is intended to slow her movement while she is firing. However, unlike D.Va, there was an issue that prevented this slow from working while firing from the air.OVERWATCH PATCH NOTES – MARCH 21, 2017

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Hero: Orisa (Tank)
Built from the scraps of the city’s decommissioned OR15 defense bots, Orisa is still learning how to optimally perform her function. What she lacks in experience, she makes up for in her steadfast dedication to keeping her city—and her creator, Efi—safe from harm.
Orisa is the sixth tank to join the Overwatch lineup, and much like her programming, her gameplay is engineered around protection. Her main weapon is a rapid-fire Fusion Driver, an automatic gun with good range and accuracy even at a distance—though it comes at a cost. Orisa’s movement slows down while she fires and players will need to plan for a lengthy reload time. Her alternate fire, Halt!, launches a graviton charge across the map, slowing nearby enemies as it passes, then pulling them toward it when it detonates.
Her Fortify ability boosts her personal defense, reducing damage taken and making her unstoppable for a short time. She can throw a device that creates a curved, stationary Protective Barrier, perfect for intercepting projectiles and shielding teammates from the front, sides, and above. Lastly, as her ultimate ability, Orisa deploys a high-powered Supercharger that beams a buff to allies within its range, increasing the damage they can inflict on the opposing team.
To learn more about Orisa, click here.
GENERAL UPDATES
Competitive Play
On Route 66, the attacking team is now given 60 additional seconds after pushing the payload to the first checkpoint.
Developer Comments: This change will bring Route 66 in line with the other Escort maps.
Custom Game and Game Browser
When setting up a Custom Game, players can now disable or modify abilities activated with the secondary fire button
HERO UPDATES
Ana
Biotic Rifle
Damage decreased from 80 to 60
Developer Comments: Ana’s kit has several strong components, which makes her difficult to replace. Reducing her damage output will make her less threatening on attack and reduce her dueling capabilities.
Bastion
Ironclad
[XB1, PS4] Bastion now takes 20% less damage while in Configuration: Sentry or Tank (formerly 35%)
Developer Comments: After the last update, Bastion became a little too difficult to deal with, so we’re reducing his new passive to give enemies more opportunities to counter.
Junkrat
Total Mayhem
Junkrat’s explosions no longer hurt himself
Developer Comments: Previously, Junkrat’s projectile speed made him difficult to use at long ranges, but the damage he took from his own explosions made him difficult to use at close ranges. This change makes him more effective at close ranges, allowing Junkrat players to explore new strategies.
Mercy
Caduceus Staff
The amount of increased damage that’s done when boosting another player is now tracked under the match statistics and on the Career Profile page
Sombra
Hack
Sombra’s teammates can now see hacked healthpacks through walls
Stealth
Sound effects and VO distance has been reduced to 15 meters when Sombra enters or exits Stealth
Translocator
Cooldown reduced from 6 seconds to 4 seconds
Developer Comments: Sombra can be devastating in the right hands, but infiltrating and harassing enemies could often feel difficult. These changes should increase her effectiveness and teamplay.
Winston
Barrier Projector
Ability cooldown now starts when the barrier is placed, instead of when it ends
Developer Comments: This change should help Winston do what he does best: distract the enemy team and block damage.
Zarya
Particle Barrier
No longer protects Zarya from knockback
Projected Barrier
No longer protects allies from knockback
Developer Comments: This is actually reverting a change that we made a few patches ago, which made players immune to knockbacks if they were hit by an effect from inside her barrier. This had some negative side effects, such as making targets immune to knockbacks from effects that pierce barriers, like Reinhardt’s charge and Winston’s Primal Rage punches. Now, these will cause knockback again. This does not affect knockbacks from effects that originate from outside her barriers, such as Pharah’s Concussive Blast. Those will still be blocked by the barriers, not causing any knockback.
Zenyatta
Orb of Destruction
Alternate fire cooldown has been reduced from 1 seconds to 0.6 seconds
Weapon spread has been removed
Developer Comments: Zenyatta’s alternate fire often felt too difficult to use due to its long recovery time. This reduction should make it a more viable option. Also, his weapon has always had a very small amount of spread. This wasn’t enough to change the way he was played, but it would occasionally cause shots to miss that would normally hit their target. Removing this small variance should help him feel more consistent.
BUG FIXES
General
When Teleporters, Shield Generators, and other player-owned objects are destroyed, the kill feed now properly displays the owner’s name

HERO UPDATES
General
The total damage reduction that a hero can receive while buffed (e.g. from Ana's Nano Boost and Orisa's Fortify) has been capped at 50% (formerly 70%)
Bastion
Ironclad
Bastion now takes 20% less damage while in Configuration: Sentry or Tank (formerly 35%)
Developer Comments: After introducing the new Ironclad passive ability in the last patch, Bastion felt a little too difficult to deal with. This reduction maintains his survivability while he’s transformed, but he shouldn’t feel so overbearing to enemies.
Zarya
Particle Barrier
No longer protects Zarya from knockback
Projected Barrier
No longer protects allies from knockback
Developer Comments: This change is actually reverting an attempted bug fix from a previous patch. Now, Zarya’s barriers no longer protect players who are hit by a knockback effect that pierces the shield. This change does not affect knockback abilities that occur outside the barriers. For example, if Zarya has a barrier on herself and is hit by one of Pharah’s concussive blasts, she won’t be affected, because the barrier blocked the effect. However, if Winston uses his ultimate and starts to swing at Zarya, it will now knock her back even if a protective barrier is active, since melee attacks pierce barriers.
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed an issue preventing heroes in 1v1 Mystery Duel from being shuffled correctly
Competitive Play
Fixed an issue preventing players from loading the Season 1 and 2 leaderboards
Heroes
Fixed an issue preventing D.Va’s Defense Matrix from properly blocking enemy fire that has passed through another enemy hero
Fixed an issue preventing Winston’s hitbox from lining up with his pose while crouched

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Feature: Game Browser
Starting today, every player can create their own, unique Overwatch experience and share it with their friends, teammates, or the entire world. Introducing the Game Browser.
An extension of Overwatch's Custom Game mode, the Game Browser allows you to adjust the settings on various maps, modes, and heroes to create your own tailor-made match. For example, if you want to increase the speed of Pharah’s rockets or remove the cooldown from McCree's Combat Roll, the power is yours. Once you're happy with your settings, and you're ready to launch your game, you'll need to set up permissions. You can limit the people who can join your game by toggling the "Friends Only" or "Invite Only" options, but if you want to put your strange creation to a real test, set your server to "Public" and click the launch button.
If you'd like to learn more about the Game Browser, click here.
New Mode: Capture the Flag
Capture the Rooster has been, without a doubt, Overwatch’s most popular brawl. We don’t want the excitement to end, so we’re bringing Capture the Flag to the Arcade as an ongoing game mode. Starting today, we’re adding Capture the Flag versions of Nepal, Lijiang Tower, Ilios, and Oasis, which gives you 12 maps to try when creating a Custom Game.
HERO UPDATES
Ana
New Hero Option: Nano Boost Sensitivity
Allows players to adjust Nano Boost’s targeting sensitivity
Bastion
Configuration: Sentry
Reconfiguration time decreased from 1.5 seconds to 1.0 second
Bullet spread increased by 50%
Bullet spread is always at maximum (it no longer increases as the weapon is fired)
Magazine size increased from 200 to 300
No longer deals critical damage
Configuration: Recon
Bullet spread decreased by 25%
Magazine size increased from 20 to 25
Self-Repair
Can now be used while moving
Now bound to secondary fire (formerly Ability 2)
No longer interrupted by taking damage
A new resource meter has been added that depletes while Self-Repair is active and recharges when not in use
Configuration: Tank
No longer grants bonus armor
New Passive Ability: Ironclad
Bastion takes 35% less damage while in Configuration: Sentry or Tank
Developer Comments: The goal of these changes is to move some of Bastion's power from Configuration: Sentry to Recon, while keeping its sentry mode a strong option, especially versus tanks and barriers. Overall, Bastion should feel stronger and more flexible with these changes.
D.Va
Defense Matrix
Enemy shots no longer need to travel a minimum distance before they can be blocked
Developer Comments: Previously, there was a minimum distance a projectile had to travel before it could be destroyed by Defense Matrix. This made it nearly worthless in situations where an enemy was right next to your teammate, such as when Roadhog hooks your ally. This change removes that restriction so Defense Matrix should now reliably destroy projectiles regardless of how far they have traveled.
Mei
Cryo-Freeze
Can now be targeted by allies while in Cryo-Freeze
Mercy
Resurrect
While performing a resurrection, Mercy now becomes temporarily invulnerable along with the allies being revived
Caduceus Staff
Zenyatta can no longer be targeted while Transcendence is active
New Hero Option: Guardian Angel Sensitivity
Allows players to adjust Guardian Angel’s targeting sensitivity
New Hero Option: Beam Sensitivity
Allows players to adjust targeting sensitivity on Mercy’s Caduceus Staff beams
Developer Comments: Mercy’s Resurrect has always been very powerful, but it often forces her to sacrifice herself to use it well. There have been changes in the past that attempted to help her in this area, but haven’t done enough to solve it. This change means that once she uses the ability, she will always survive long enough to be with her team again.
Roadhog
Scrap Gun
Spread decreased by 20%
Chain Hook
Targets are now pulled to a location 3.5 meters away, up from 2 meters
Cooldown increased from 6 to 8
Developer Comments: Overall, the Roadhog changes reduce the power of his hook a bit, but his gun is now more effective when not using the hook.
Sombra
New Hero Option: Hack Sensitivity
Allows players to adjust the targeting sensitivity on Sombra’s Hack ability
Torbjörn
Rivet Gun
Ammo is now loaded earlier in the reload animation
Widowmaker
New Hero Option: Grappling Hook Sensitivity
Allows players to adjust Grappling Hook’s targeting sensitivity
Zarya
New Hero Option: Projected Barrier Sensitivity
Allows players to adjust Projected Barrier’s targeting sensitivity
Zenyatta
New Hero Option: Harmony Orb Sensitivity
Allows players to adjust Harmony Orb’s targeting sensitivity
New Hero Option: Discord Orb Sensitivity
Allows players to adjust Discord Orb’s targeting sensitivity
COMPETITIVE PLAY
General
Players with a skill rating above 3000 will need to complete at least seven games per week to avoid skill rating decay
Skill ratings below 500 will no longer be displayed.
Developer Comments: We’ve noticed that some players have been deliberately throwing their matches in an effort to reach the lowest attainable skill rating. We obviously don’t want to incentivize this behavior, because Competitive Play works best when everybody is trying. The changes to the skill rating decay system will improve the accuracy of the player’s skill rating, make maintaining multiple high-level accounts more difficult, and make upper-tier placement more meaningful.
MAP BALANCE CHANGES
General
Respawn Delay
When attackers outnumber defenders while taking a control point on Assault, Escort and Assault/Escort maps, the defenders’ respawn time will slowly increase until it hits a maximum value or the defense manages to gain the upper hand.
Developer Comments: Until now, stalling an attack by repeatedly throwing yourself at the point has been a common defensive strategy on Assault, Escort and Assault/Escort maps—even when the attackers have a decisive advantage. Typically, this tactic doesn’t change the outcome of battle; it simply delays the attackers’ progress.
Eichenwalde
A second gate no longer closes after the payload passes through the castle doors. Instead, rubble from the damaged doorway partially blocks the entrance.
Developer Comments: Once the offensive team gets through the castle entrance, the map becomes very heavily stacked in the defense’s favor. This change will give the offense more entrance options, which should improve the map’s overall balance.
BUG FIXES
General
Fixed an audio bug that prevented the point capture sound from increasing in pitch as the capture progressed
Fixed an issue preventing key bindings on the communication wheel from displaying properly
Fixed a bug causing some key bindings to revert to default after the first round of a Control map
Fixed a bug that allowed commendation cards to be recalculated and transferred to a new player after the previous recipient left at the end of a round
Fixed a bug that caused the “experience gained” audio effects to continue playing, even after the players left the game lobby

A.I.

Competitive Play
Fixed a bug preventing “60 seconds remaining” and “30 seconds remaining” voice lines from playing during the second round of a match
Heroes
Fixed a bug preventing Lucio’s “Sound Barriers Provided” statistic from being properly calculated
Fixed a bug preventing Reinhardt’s Charge from properly pinning targets
Fixed a bug preventing Reinhardt’s shield from displaying cracks at low health with the Wujing skin equipped

Players can now bind individual sprays, emotes, and voice lines to mouse buttons, unique keys, or controller buttons

HERO BALANCE UPDATES
Ana
Biotic Grenade
Effect duration has been reduced from 5 seconds to 4 seconds
Healing boost on allies has been decreased by 50%
Developer Comments: The healing boost from Ana’s Biotic Grenade was providing too much healing, especially when used on targets with large health pools.
D.Va
Health increased from 200 to 400
Armor decreased from 400 to 200
Fusion Cannons
Bullet damage decreased from 3 to 2
Number of bullets per shot has been increased from 8 to 11
Developer Comments: D.Va’s armor often made her feel like she had no weaknesses, even against heroes that are typically effective against bigger targets (like Reaper). The changes to her primary fire will result in a small overall decrease in damage, but her Fusion Cannons should feel more consistent now.
Lucio
New Hero Option: Allow Backwards Wall Ride
When enabled, allows Lucio to start wall riding while moving backwards.
Roadhog
Chain Hook
Targets are now pulled directly in front of Roadhog (rather than straight to him), except in cases where Roadhog drastically rotates
Hooked targets are now released if they leave Roadhog’s line of sight before being pulled
Line of sight checks (which determines if targets are hit by the hook) are now done from Roadhog’s position, rather than the hook’s position
Developer Comments: The hook should now feel more consistent for Roadhog players, but it should also feel more reasonable to his enemies, as they cannot be hooked or pulled around corners anymore.
Sombra
Hack
Cooldown has been reduced from 12 seconds to 8 seconds
Time it takes to hack a target has been decreased from 1 second to 0.8 seconds
Developer Comments: Sombra often had difficulty hacking enemies, even when she surprised the target. This change should help her execute hacks more easily.

GENERAL UPDATES
General
Added a new "Boop" unlockable voice line for Sombra
Players can now select the 1v1 Mystery Duel and 3v3 Elimination game modes from the Custom Game menu
Added a "Stay as Team" feature, which allows players to remain grouped with their teammates after the match has ended
HERO BALANCE UPDATES
Symmetra
Photon Barrier (New Ability)
Replaces her existing Photon Shield ability
Generates a large energy barrier in front of Symmetra that blocks enemy fire as it travels forward
Shield Generator (New Ultimate Ability Option)
Symmetra's Ultimate ability now offers a choice between Teleporter and a new option: Shield Generator
Shield Generator places a device that grants additional shields to allies within its effective radius (regardless of barriers, walls, or obstacles between them and the Shield Generator)
Photon Projector (Primary Fire)
Range has been increased from 5 meters to 7 meters
Sentry Turret
Turrets that can be carried have been increased from 3 turrets to 6 turrets
Cooldown has been reduced from 12 seconds to 10 seconds
Photon Shield
Replaced with the new Photon Barrier ability
Teleporter
Health has been decreased from 200 to 50
Shields have been increased from 0 to 350
Developer Comments: We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn't feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modes.
To address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team.
For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn"t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations.
The turret changes allow her to rebuild her turret nests faster. Even if all her turrets are wiped out, it's now easier for players to build them all back up before the next push.
We're also increasing the range on her Photon Projector to make it easier for her to build up and keep a powerful charge on her target.
Zarya
Particle Barrier/Projected Barrier
Attacks like Reinhardt's Fire Strike or Hanzo's Dragonstrike that deal damage to both the barrier and the hero within the barrier, no longer deal damage to the barrier twice
Developer Comments: This is a bug fix, but we think it's significant enough to warrant a separate note. We've had a long-standing bug that caused "piercing" damage to hit Zarya's barrier twice. Sometimes this benefited Zarya (for example, jumping in front of Reinhardt's Fire Strike was a good way to generate a large amount of energy quickly), and sometimes it really hurt her (Genji's Dragonblade, for example, would cut through her shield in one swing, instead of two). This change isn't intended to buff or a nerf to Zarya. We're simply trying get her abilities working as they should, and we'll keep an eye on how it affects her balance.

PATCH FEATURES
New Hero: Sombra (Offense)
One of the world's most notorious hackers is stepping out of the shadows: Sombra, a mysterious infiltrator who uses information to control those in power.
Sombra is a master manipulator who can hack her enemies, temporarily blocking their abilities. In addition, she can hack health packs and Torbjorn's turret, making them useless to her opponents. She uses her fully automatic Machine Pistol to take out her enemies, getting into position using her Thermoptic Camo, which allows her to become invisible and move more quickly for short periods of time. This gives her the ability to slip past enemy defenses undetected, but she's instantly revealed if she takes damage or attacks an enemy. She also has a Translocator, which can be tossed like a grenade. When it’s activated, Sombra is teleported to its location (even while it’s in flight).
Sombra's ultimate ability, EMP, discharges electromagnetic energy in a wide radius, hacking anyone caught within range and destroying enemy barriers and shields. To learn more about Sombra, click here.
New Feature: The Arcade!
Discover brand new ways to play Overwatch in the Arcade. Choose from a variety of regularly rotating game modes, maps, and rulesets that don't quite fit into Quick Play or Competitive Play. Whether it's 1-on-1 duels, 3-vs-3 skirmishes, our alternating selection of brawls, or special rulesets like “no hero switching,” you should have no problem finding a game that fits your mood. Experience is earned just like any other mode, but you can also earn Arcade-specific rewards, like Loot Boxes!
New Arena Map: Ecopoint: Antarctica
Bundle up for a journey to Ecopoint: Antarctica, the former Overwatch installation where climatologist Mei-Ling Zhou was once stationed. While researching severe weather anomalies in the region, the station was hit by an intense polar storm. Running out of options and low on supplies, the team decided to cryogenically freeze themselves until the storm passed. They believed that it would only be for a few months, but Mei awoke nearly a decade later.
Ecopoint: Antarctica is a compact new Arena map that features multiple new game modes, including a 3-vs-3 battle and 1-on-1 duel. Check it out in the Arcade.
Season 3 of Competitive Play
Competitive Play's second season will end on November 23 at 4PM PDT (November 24 at 0:00 UTC), and the third season will begin on November 30 at 4PM PDT (December 1 at 0:00 UTC). During the week-long off season, you'll still be able to queue for matches using the Competitive Play ruleset, but your skill rating will not be affected and no Competitive Points will be awarded.
We've also made a few adjustments to the skill rating system for season 3. Players will be distributed more broadly across the skill tiers, which means that your season 3 rating will probably be lower than the previous season.
Developer Comments: When season 2 started, we had more players in the Gold and Platinum skill tiers than we originally intended. This meant that skill levels varied widely for players within those tiers, and some players were achieving inappropriately high rankings during their placement matches. These players typically began the season by having their skill rating adjusted downwards after their first few matches. For season 3, skill ratings will be slightly lower after your placement matches, allowing them to increase as the season begins. After you play enough matches, your skill rating changes will return to normal.
GENERAL UPDATES
General
Made a number of data format improvements, which should decrease load times and reduce the game’s storage space requirements
Made several adjustments to the amount of experience needed to level:
The amount of experience needed to reach levels 2 through 13 remains unchanged
The amount of experience needed to reach levels 14 through 100 has been slightly reduced
The amount of experience needed to reach levels after 100 is now constant (20,000 XP) and will no longer reset after each promotion
Developer Comments: With the way our experience curve works right now, players move fairly quickly through the first 23 levels of each tier (1-23, 101-123, 201-223, etc.). This is because when a player is promoted after 100 levels, the experience curve resets. While this reset has worked pretty well so far, it’s also encouraged some people to stop playing the game after they’re promoted—hoping to save those first 23 levels for a seasonal event. To help address this, the experience needed for all post-promotion levels (any level after 100) is now consistently 20,000 and will no longer reset. The total experience required to gain 100 levels after a promotion is roughly unchanged, but the total experience required to earn the first 100 levels (before the first promotion) has been slightly reduced.
Quick Play matches are now restricted to one of each hero per team
Developer Comments: We’ve been monitoring your feedback to the 1-hero limit in Competitive Play. Overall, we believe the game is in a better place in terms of balance and stability with the hero limit in place. For this reason, we have decided to add the 1-hero limit to Quick Play. We understand that there are a lot of players who enjoy the ability to play multiples of the same hero, so we have introduced a new mode to the Arcade called “No Limits.” This mode uses Quick Play’s original ruleset, which allows for hero stacking.
Spectating
The number of observer slots in Custom Games has been increased from 6 to 12
HERO BALANCE CHANGES
General
Dealing damage to things other than players (like Torbjorn's turret or Symmetra's teleporter) no longer charges ultimate abilities
Ultimate costs have been increased by 25% for all heroes
Developer Comments: Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful.
Ana
Nano Boost
No longer increases move speed
Developer Comments: The increased speed from Ana’s Nano Boost made the ability feel unstoppable and forced Ana players to select targets that could really take advantage of the speed boost. Removing the speed boost means that Ana has a reason to apply Nano Boost to a larger variety of heroes, and enemies can fend off the attack more easily
D.Va
Call Mech
Ultimate cost has been decreased by 20%
Mech health increased to 200 (formerly 100). Armor remains at 400
Movement speed while firing has been increased by 25%
Developer Comments: We reduced the cost of the Call Mech ultimate ability to compensate for the increased ultimate cost across all heroes (detailed above). D.Va players shouldn’t experience a noticeable change. The rest of these changes help D.Va’s withstand attacks, which will allow her to keep pressuring enemies.
Lúcio
Amp It Up
Healing per second has been decreased by 10%
Developer Comments: Lucio’s overall healing output has always been on par with (or even higher) than Overwatch’s other healers, and his other benefits made him an almost mandatory pick.
Mei
Blizzard
Ultimate cost has been increased by 15%
Developer Comments: Mei’s ultimate was recently given a much larger radius. Now it’s coming up too frequently, considering the impact it can have.
Mercy
Passive health regeneration now activates when Mercy avoids taking damage for 1 second (formerly 3 seconds)
Developer Comments: This change allows Mercy to survive more easily by evading enemy fire.
Pharah
Rocket Launcher
Minimum explosion damage has been increased by 13%
Minimum explosion knockback has been decreased to 0%
Jump Jets
Lift increased by 35%
Developer Comments: These changes will make the explosions from Pharah's Rocket Launcher more deadly, so hitting multiple targets should feel better. Her Jump Jets are also getting a boost to increase maneuverability while hovering.
Soldier: 76
Pulse Rifle
Bullet damage increased from 17 to 20
Maximum bullet spread increased from 2.2 to 2.4
Developer Comments: Soldier: 76's damage felt a little low when compared to similar heroes. This increase affects both his normal fire and his ultimate.
Torbjörn
Scrap is now automatically generated over time
The amount of scrap collected from a fallen enemy has been decreased by 40%
Forge Hammer
Swing speed increased by 25%
Damage decreased by 27%
Developer Comments: Armor Packs have always been a powerful tool in Torbjörn's arsenal, but it was often difficult to gather enough scrap to give your team a legitimate boost when they needed it. Conversely, if a team held on long enough, the scrap collected from fallen enemies was often able to generate so many armor packs that enemy teams had a difficult time turning the tide. Automatically generating scrap over time helps smooth out these differences and makes Torbjörn more viable. His hammer swing speed was increased to help him construct level 2 turrets more quickly.
Widowmaker
Venom Mine
Explosion no longer damages the player who placed the mine
Widow's Kiss
Charge rate increased by 20%
Developer Comments: These changes allow Widowmaker to be more flexible and reactive.
Zarya
Particle Barrier
Power gained from barriers decreased by 20%
ProjectedBarrier
Power gained from barriers decreased by 20%
Developer Comments: Considering her potential damage output, Zarya was starting to feel like a mandatory pick in most situations. Rather than reduce her damage output, this change makes achieving her maximum power and damage output slightly more difficult.

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
New Seasonal Event: Overwatch Halloween Terror
When the shadows grow long and the nights grow cold . . . when witches cackle in the night, and ghosts roam the streets . . . it can mean only one thing: Halloween has arrived in Overwatch! Starting today, Overwatch's regular Loot Boxes have been replaced with limited-edition Halloween Loot Boxes. Each contains at least one of more than 100 Halloween-themed sprays, icons, skins, victory poses, emotes, and highlight intros. And the bravest heroes will test their mettle against a mad scientist's metal minions in Overwatch's first co-op PvE brawl: Junkenstein’s Revenge.
Welcome to Overwatch Halloween Terror!
To learn more about the event, click here.
New Feature: Leaderboards
In-game leaderboards will now show off the top 500 competitive players from each region, and a separate leaderboard will allow players to see how their competitive performance stacks up against their Battle.net friends. Plus, we’re adding leaderboards for the Overwatch Halloween Terror event that’s happening right now!
Note: After downloading the latest patch, players will need to complete at least one Competitive Play match before they’ll appear on the Battle.net friend leaderboards.
GENERAL UPDATES
General
Static cameras are now supported in spectator mode
Team names can now be edited in custom games
Raised the volume of Hanzo's Dragonstrike voice line while wearing the Okami/Lone Wolf Skin
Heroes hit by Ana's Nano Boost have a new voice line that informs other players

Competitive Play
Players who leave or are disconnected from a competitive match can now rejoin anytime while the match is still in progress
Teammates of a disconnected player can now exit a match after 2 minutes have elapsed (formerly 1 minute), and they will not receive a leaver penalty. However, they will receive a loss
Spectating
Camera movement in Spectator Mode has been improved
HERO BALANCE UPDATES
Ana
Nano Boost
Ultimate cost has been increased by 20%
Biotic Grenade
Radius has been increased from 3 to 4 meters
Developer Comments: So far, we haven't seen any indication that Ana is too strong overall, but her ultimate charges a little too fast, especially considering the impact it can have on a match. Also, her Biotic Grenades are getting a small boost to help her hit multiple targets.
Widowmaker
Widow's Kiss
Scoping-in animation time has been reduced from 0.5 to 0.33 seconds
Developer Comments: This change will help Widowmaker acquire new targets more quickly and speed up her reaction time in fast-paced situations.
Junkrat
RIP-Tire
Ability now activates more quickly
Developer Comments: Junkrat can be an extremely effective hero in the right hands, but RIP-Tire often felt underpowered when compared to his counterparts.
USER INTERFACE UPDATES
General
Hero Gallery now signify which items were unlocked during the Overwatch Halloween Terror event
Several minor aesthetic changes have been made to the game’s Main, Social, and Options menus
Removed several stats that were duplicated for certain heroes throughout the career profile
Graphics, typography, and layout have been updated in the Player Profile menu
Controller users can now choose between two aiming modes
Dual-Zone mode (New default): The vast majority of the thumbstick's range moves with reduced sensitivity and relatively high acceleration. However, when the thumbstick crosses to the outer 10% of its range, it will move with high sensitivity and relatively low acceleration. This mode will allow for more precise aiming, while still allowing players to turn around quickly
Exponential Ramp mode (Old default): As the thumbstick moves toward the outside of its range, the sensitivity is ramped up exponentially. The acceleration remains relatively high throughout
Social Features
Certain commendations will now appear less frequently during end-of-round voting, and others will appear more frequently (e.g. Torbjörn's Armor Packs Created will appear less frequently while Offensive Assists will appear more frequently)
BUG FIXES

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
Competitive Play Season 2
We've made some big changes to Competitive Play in Season 2. The most noticeable change is the introduction of skill tiers, which we hope will better communicate players' relative skill levels. Competitive Play will put a greater emphasis on skill tiers over specific ratings, and as such, a player's tier will be more prominently displayed throughout the game. We've also switched the skill rating system to a 1-5000 scale to give players more detailed information about how each match affects their specific rating.
Sudden Death is also going away in Season 2. Instead, matches that are tied when the clock runs out end in a draw—though, it should be a rare occurrence. Because of this, we've made some changes to our game modes in Competitive Play to help reduce the chance that a draw can happen.
We've also made a few minor adjustments to leaver penalties, the Top 500 system, and the competitive point system. Read on below to learn more!
New Assault/Escort Map: Eichenwalde
The forest has slowly begun overtaking the abandoned village of Eichenwalde, but the scars will never completely fade. During the Omnic Crisis, Eichenwalde was the site of a key battle. General Balderich von Adler took a handful of crusaders to the village in an effort to outflank the omnic army. Balderich's soldiers were able to break down the enemy forces, giving the German military an opportunity to push back, but the Crusaders didn't make it out of the battle. General Balderich finally collapsed in the castle's great hall.
GENERAL UPDATES
General
When activating the "Ultimate Status" communication, Symmetra now reports the number of charges left on her teleporter
When activating the "Needs healing" communication while targeting a teammate, Ana, Lúcio, Mercy, and Zenyatta will now tell allies to group up to receive healing. A marker will also appear above the player's head, allowing teammates to locate the healer more quickly
Added Torbjörn as an AI-controlled hero in Practice vs. AI, Play vs. AI, and Custom Game modes
Sit and laugh emotes are now unlockable for all heroes
New Legendary skins have been added for Reinhardt
Competitive Play
Skill rating is now measured on a 1-5000 scale instead of the former 1-100 scale
Skill Rating Tiers
Players will now be assigned to a tier, depending on their skill rating
Bronze - 1-1499
Silver - 1500-1999
Gold - 2000-2499
Platinum - 2500-2999
Diamond - 3000-3499
Master - 3500-3999
Grandmaster - 4000-5000
In Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tiers, a player will not drop out of their tier even if their skill rating falls below the cutoff
In Master and Grandmaster tiers, a player whose skill rating falls below the tier's minimum will be moved to a lower tier
Players that have reached the Master and Grandmaster tiers must be within 500 Skill Rating of their groupmates
Players that are Diamond-tier and below must be within 1000 Skill Rating of their groupmates
Skill Rating Decay
Players in Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster tiers that haven't participated in a competitive match for 7 days will lose skill rating
Players with a skill rating above 3000 (Diamond tier or higher) will lose 50 rating points every 24 hours, but their rating will not fall below 3000
Competing in a single match will halt skill rating decay
Players that haven't participated in a competitive match for 7 days will immediately drop out of the top 500
Map Changes
Several refinements have been made to the time bank system for Hanamura, Temple of Anubis, and Volskaya Industries
The time bank system has been added to Dorado, Hollywood, King's Row, Numbani, Route 66, and Watchpoint: Gibraltar
Time granted for taking objectives on Dorado, Hanamura, Hollywood, King's Row, Numbani, Route 66, Temple of Anubis, Volskaya Industries, and Watchpoint: Gibraltar has been reduced from 5 minutes to 4
Competitive Points
Existing competitive points saved from Season 1 will be multiplied by 10
After winning a competitive match, players will now receive 10 competitive points (instead of 1)
Players will now receive 3 competitive points for a draw
The cost of golden weapons has also been multiplied by 10 - from 300 to 3000
A soft cap is being placed on the number of competitive points that can be saved
Players with more than 6000 points at the start of season 2 will no longer accrue points by playing competitive matches
End-of-season rewards will still be granted to players at the soft cap
Instead of going into sudden death, tied competitive matches will now result in a draw
Players must now win at least 50 competitive matches to be eligible for a spot in the Top 500
Players must now complete more matches to clear their penalty status for leaving a competitive match early
HERO BALANCE UPDATES
General
Ultimates that consume the ultimate meter when activated will now drain the meter more quickly (.25 second instead of 1 second)
Reverted a recent change that reduced the size of heroes' projectiles
Most hero abilities will no longer interrupt quick melee attacks
Ultimate abilities will now interrupt quick melee attacks
Developer Comments: Altering the size of projectiles in flight had too many unintended side effects to keep in the game, at least in its current form. We will continue watching this and make additional changes if necessary. We’re also making quick melee more consistent when interacting with enemy abilities.
D.Va
Defense Matrix
After being activated, Defense Matrix will begin regenerating following a 1-second delay (formerly .5 seconds)
Developer Comments: Defense Matrix was too efficient when tapped repeatedly, instead of being held. Now, the recovery delay matches the ability cooldown.
Hanzo
Hanzo will now experience a 30% decrease in speed while aiming (formerly 40%)
Maximum projectile speed has been increased by 30%
Arrow size has been reduced by 33%
Developer Comments: Hanzo has the potential to deal a lot of damage, but he can feel really inconsistent, even at a medium distance. By increasing the projectile speed, we’re extending his reliable range, making it easier to land shots without having to perfectly predict enemy movement. To compensate for the increased projectile speed, we’ve decreased the size of his arrows, meaning his shots now require a bit more accuracy.
Mei
Blizzard
Projectile now pierces barriers
Radius has been increased from 8 meters to 10 meters
Developer Comments: Mei has an interesting toolkit, but her ultimate often felt like it was too difficult to use effectively. Consequently, it felt weak compared to many other ultimate abilities. The freeze effect has been piercing barriers for some time now, but the projectile would still be blocked. Now, you can throw it down exactly where you want it, so it’s much easier to utilize the full radius effectively.
McCree
Deadeye
Now drains over a .25-second period (instead of displaying a 50% reduction on the ultimate meter when activated and 0% when confirmed)
Developer Comments: If players managed to counter or avoid McCree's ultimate, it would often regenerate very quickly since only half of the ultimate charge was spent. Now, this ultimate works like every other ultimate that has a duration.
Mercy
Caduceus Staff
Healing Beam
Healing-per-second has been increased by 20%
Resurrect
Resurrected allies will be able to maneuver after 2.25 seconds (reduced from 3 seconds)
Developer Comments: Resurrection now allows teammates to jump back into the fight more quickly, which should help Mercy survive after activating her ultimate. Mercy's healing is also getting a boost to solidify her role as a strong, single-target healer.
Genji
Double jump no longer resets when wall climbing
Swift Strike
No longer deals damage to traps like Widowmaker's Venom Mine or Junkrat's Steel Trap
No longer bypasses Junkrat's Steel Trap
No longer interrupts quick melee attacks
Dragonblade
Duration of Genji's ultimate has been reduced from 8 seconds to 6 seconds
Developer Comments: Genji was a little too difficult to pin down, and these changes will balance his speed. Swift Strike no longer cancels the recovery time from a quick melee attack, so players will no longer be able to get a free melee attack before using Swift Strike. Lastly, Dragonblade's duration was long enough that it often felt too difficult to reasonably counter.
Lúcio
Amp It Up
The boosting of movement speed has been decreased by 30% (from a 100% increase to a 70% increase)
Developer Comments: Thanks to Lúcio's speed increase, he was almost a must pick in every lineup.
Roadhog
Chain Hook
If the hooked target isn't in Roadhog's line of sight when retracting the hook, they will be moved back to the position where they were originally hooked
Developer Comments: This change means that hooked targets will be less likely to slide along walls, potentially ending up in an odd place after they've been reeled in.
Soldier: 76
Heavy Pulse Rifle
Bullet spread now happens more quickly when unloading fully-automatic pulse fire
Significantly Increased bullet spread recovery time
Developer Comments: These changes will make burst-firing feel more reliable and increase his effectiveness at longer ranges.
Zenyatta
Orb of Discord
The amount of damage amplified by a target with Orb of Discord has been decreased from 50% to 30%
Orb of Destruction
Damage has been increased from 40 to 46
Developer Comments: Zenyatta is in a far better place since the last update, but the strength of Orb of Discord has turned him into an almost mandatory pick. These changes reduce Orb of Discord's effectiveness, but his damage-dealing potential has been increased. The amount of damage that he delivers should feel largely unaffected by the change.
MAP BALANCE UPDATES
Watchpoint: Gibraltar
Watchpoint: Gibraltar’s first checkpoint has been removed
Developer Comments: The balance changes that were implemented in previous patches have eliminated the need for Watchpoint: Gibraltar to have an extra checkpoint.
USER INTERFACE UPDATES
General
A new "Allied Health Bars" option has been added (Options > Controls)
Contextual menus have been added on the hero selection screen, giving players the ability to report or group up with other players
Matchmaking UI is now purple in the Competitive Play queue
Made several minor adjustments to typography in the Spectator UI

Ana’s attacks and abilities now activate the controller’s rumble function
The alternate fire on McCree’s Peacekeeper ability now activates the controller’s rumble function for all six shots
Maps
Fixed an issue preventing Genji and Hanzo from reliably climbing a specific crate on Watchpoint: Gibraltar
Fixed several issues that allowed Reaper to reach unintended locations on Watchpoint: Gibraltar
User Interface
Competitive play leaver messaging no longer overlaps with the PvP HUD at the top of the screen
Fixed a bug causing the end of season banner to pop up while the player is in a match
Fixed a bug preventing the hero list in Custom Game settings from being organized alphabetically
The spectate option now becomes unavailable (the button will be greyed out) when all spectator slots have been filled in a Custom Game lobby

HERO BALANCE UPDATES
Ana
Biotic Rifle
Rate of fire increased by 20%
Magazine size increased from 8 to 10
Developer Comments: While Ana has been very well received, she was showing to be a little bit weaker overall. In addition to helping her feel better to play, these changes should also increase her healing and damage output.
McCree
Peacemaker
Primary Fire
Damage falloff range decreased by 10 meters
Damage falloff amount is unchanged
As a result, even with this change, McCree’s effective range is still higher than it was at launch
Alternate Fire
Rate of fire increased by 15%
Flashbang
Recovery time (i.e. the amount of time before McCree can fire again) decreased from 0.5 seconds to 0.35 seconds
Developer Comments: McCree’s latest range increase helped him quite a bit, but it was a bit too much in the right hands. This change weakens his long range damage somewhat, but still keeps it stronger than it has been in the recent past. The other changes combine to allow him to land more alternate fire shots on targets that he has hit with Flashbang.
BUG FIXES
Heroes
Targets of Ana’s Sleep Dart will no longer instantly recover when damaged (recovery time is now 0.5 seconds)
User Interface
Fixed UI compatibility issues for ATI cards
Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause Lúcio, Mei, and other models to only partially render (or disappear)

PATCH FEATURES
New Hero: Ana (Support)
After being out of the fight for several years, one of Overwatch's founding members is returning. Introducing Ana—a battle-scarred veteran who supports her teammates from a distance using a unique and highly specialized collection of weapons.
Ana’s primary weapon is her Biotic Rifle, which fires long-range darts that can restore the health of her allies or deal ongoing damage to her enemies. Meanwhile, her Biotic Grenade is perfect for a close-quarters clash, simultaneously healing teammates and injuring foes caught in its small area of effect. (Affected allies will also receive a temporary increase to all incoming healing, while affected enemies can’t be healed for a few moments.) And if the battle starts to get out of hand, Ana's sidearm can fire a Sleep Dart, knocking her adversaries unconscious.
Plus, Ana's ultimate ability, Nano Boost, empowers one of her teammates, granting faster movement, increased damage, and resistance to enemy attacks.
To learn more about Ana, click here.
GENERAL UPDATES
Gameplay
If a match goes into Overtime for more than 20 seconds, the fuse will now start to "burn down" more quickly
Players now respawn more slowly during Overtime (increased spawn time by 2 seconds)
Competitive Play
Competitive Play matches can now only have one of each hero per team.
Miscellaneous
Added Ana as an AI-controlled hero in Practice vs. AI, Play vs. AI, and Custom Game modes
Timing on Zenyatta's Rapid Discord achievement is more lenient
Targeted teammates now respond by saying "I'm with you," when players use the “Group Up” communication
Renamed five sprays to avoid duplicate titles
HERO BALANCE UPDATES
General
Self-healing abilities now charge ultimate abilities. As a result, some heroes’ ultimate costs have been adjusted (see below).
Bastion
Configuration: Tank
Ultimate cost increased by 10%
D.Va
Defense Matrix
Cooldown decreased from 10 seconds to 1 second
A new resource meter has been added. This meter will deplete while Defense Matrix is active and then recharge when it’s not in use.
Defense Matrix takes 10 seconds to reach full charge from empty
At a full charge, Defense Matrix will last for 4 seconds
Defense Matrix will now remain active as long as its assigned hotkey is held
Defense Matrix has been reclassified as an alternate fire and is now bound to RMB (by default)
An option to "Toggle Defense Matrix" has been added under Options > Controls > D.Va
Self-Destruct
Ultimate cost decreased by 15%
Explosion delay reduced from 4 seconds to 3 seconds
Explosion no longer damages D.Va (the player who activates it)
Developer Notes: D.Va isn't being selected as often as our other tanks, and we feel a lot of that stems from the underperformance of her damage absorption abilities. So, we've reconfigured her Defensive Matrix, making it more flexible and giving players the ability to use it more often. We’ve also given Self-Destruct a little more oomph, because it felt slightly underwhelming when compared to many of Overwatch's other ultimate abilities.
Lúcio
Sound Barrier
Ultimate cost increased by 10%
McCree
Peacekeeper
Now maintains full damage at longer distances, but will deal less damage at extreme ranges
Developer Notes: While the game does feel better following the nerf to McCree’s close-range damage in a previous patch, it left him a little too weak. So, we're increasing his effective distance, making his range similar to Soldier: 76’s. This should hopefully give players another option for dealing with pesky long-range damage dealing heroes like Pharah and Hanzo.
Mercy
Caduceus Staff
Damage Boost
Effect will no longer stack with bonus damage provided by another Mercy
Resurrect
Ultimate charge cost increased by 30%
Movement is no longer prevented during activation
Guardian Angel instantly resets upon use
Developer Notes: Mercy's ultimate is one of the most powerful abilities in the game; however, players would often fly into the fray and die while using it. With this update, Resurrect will now take a bit longer to charge, but Mercy will be a lot safer when activating the ability in the middle of combat.
Roadhog
Whole Hog
Ultimate cost increased by 45%
Soldier: 76
Heavy Pulse Rifle
Spread recovery will begin after a short delay (rather than instantly)
Tactical Visor
Ultimate cost increased by 10%
Zenyatta
Base shields increased by 50 (now 50 Health/150 Shield)
Primary fire weapon damage decreased from 45 to 40
Alternate fire weapon damage increased from 35 to 40
Orb of Discord and Orb of Harmony
Projectile speed has been increased from 30 to 120
Transcendence
Movement speed is now doubled upon activation
Healing amount increased from 200 to 300 health per second
Developer Notes: While Zenyatta has never had the healing abilities of Lúcio or Mercy, he made up for it by dealing more damage. However, his lack of mobility and low health has meant he’s struggled to find a place in many games. To increase his effectiveness, we've made several changes, the biggest of which is an increased shield pool. This will allow him to go head-to-head with more enemies. The Orb of Harmony and Discord changes are also a quality of life change, helping Zenyatta move his orbs around and apply their effects more quickly. And lastly, we’ve increased Transcendence’s healing throughput. This ultimate was designed to be the most effective against sustained, high-damage fire and least effective against short, high-damage bursts (like D.Va’s or Junkrat's ultimates). But, due to the amount of healing it provided, there were times when it was possible for even sustained fire to overcome Transcendence’s output. We’ve made the heal powerful and also allowed Zenyatta to move around more quickly while it’s active.
USER INTERFACE UPDATES
Game Options
Players can now enter numerical values for any option that also has slider (e.g. FoV, volume, sensitivity, etc.)
Players can now hide in-game chat by pressing CTRL-SHIFT-C or by typing "/hidechat" into the chat window
Controls
Mouse sensitivity can now be adjusted out to two decimals
Gameplay

Friend notifications can now be toggled on or off
Whispers can now be toggled on or off
Video
Added 21:9 aspect ratio support
Players can now enable a real-world clock by toggling the "Display System Clock" setting
Social Features
Certain commendations will now appear less frequently during end-of-round voting (e.g. Zenyatta’s Transcendence Healing and Zarya’s Projected Barriers Applied)
BUG FIXES
General
The Hero Gallery now remembers the last hero you were looking at and will properly highlight that hero whenever returning to the gallery
Fixed a bug that caused the “payload is nearing its final destination” music to continue playing even after the match was over
Fixed a bug that caused the UI to disappear whenever the game was forced into windowed mode by an external application
Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause visual healing effects to appear on the wrong hero whenever multiple players attempted to pick up a Health Pack
Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause different heroes’ victory poses to clip into each other
Fixed several lighting issues with the killcam
Maps
The payload on King’s Row will no longer retreat back inside its starting location if the attacking team fails to push it
Adjusted the Hero Select screen volume for the attacking team on Watchpoint: Gibraltar
Added Spectator camera collision to most maps
Fixed issues with player collision across multiple maps
Fixed issues with ambient lighting and shadows across multiple maps
Heroes
Fixed a bug that caused D.Va to sometimes ignore player collision when summoning her mech
Reduced the chance for larger projectiles (i.e. Hanzo's arrows, Zenyatta's orbs) to hit targets around corners
Fixed a bug where Mei’s Ice Wall would persist in the game world even after the player switched heroes or left the game
Fixed even more bugs that allowed Reaper to Shadow Step to unintended locations
Fixed a bug that sometimes caused Reinhardt’s Barrier Field to get stuck in the “on” position if the player used the “Toggle Barrier” setting
Fixed a bug that sometimes caused Roadhog to accidentally Chain Hook targets standing behind him
Fixed a bug that caused Winston’s Barrier Projector shield to ignore the “Sound Effects Volume” setting
Competitive Play
Fixed a bug that sometimes caused players not to be able to rejoin games

Note: If you leave a single Competitive Play match more than 3 times, you will receive a Competitive Play “leave” penalty even if you complete the match.A new patch is now live on Windows PC. Read below to learn about the latest changes.

PATCH FEATURES
New Feature: Competitive Play
Overwatch is raising the bar for competitive players, giving them the perfect arena to sharpen their skills and hone their strategies. Introducing Competitive Play.
Competitive Play is designed for players who truly want to put their skills to the test, and offers a more serious experience than our Quick Play or Weekly Brawl! modes. To make sure everyone playing the mode has a solid understanding of the game’s mechanics, maps, and heroes, Competitive Play will be locked until you hit level 25.
Once you reach level 25, the mode will become available under the "Play" button in the main menu. Simply select "Competitive Play" from the submenu, and you're ready to enter a match. You can join on your own or in a group, and Overwatch’s matchmaking system will automatically find the best game possible for your (or your group's) skill level.
Competitive Play is live right now! To learn more about this new feature, click here.

GENERAL
Disabled "Avoid This Player" functionality
Note: The game UI option is still active, but will be removed in a future patch
Developer comments: The "Prefer"/"Avoid" player system was designed with the best intentions; however, it's not currently performing in a way that we feel is healthy for the game. While the "Prefer This Player" option is more or less working as intended (and is thus still enabled), the "Avoid This Player" option has impacted the matchmaker in negative way and led to some very poor player experiences. Although we like the idea of being able to say "hey, I'd prefer not to play with this player," the implementation of the mechanic is not where it needs to be, so we've disabled it and will be removing the UI option in a future patch.
BUG FIXES
Fixed even more bugs that allowed Reaper to Shadow Step to unintended locations on certain maps
Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause projectiles to hit Reinhardt instead of his Barrier Field in "High Bandwidth" Custom Games
Fixed several client crashes

HERO BALANCE CHANGES
McCree
Peacekeeper
Alternate Fire
Recovery time (i.e. the amount of time before McCree starts reloading) decreased from 0.75 seconds to 0.3 seconds
Bullet damage decreased from 70 to 45
Developer Comments: McCree was performing too well against all targets, making him feel like a must-pick in many situations. By reducing the damage of his alternate fire, McCree is now significantly weaker against tanks like Roadhog and Reinhardt, but still maintains his lethality against smaller targets like Tracer and Genji.
Widowmaker
Widow’s Kiss
Alternate Fire (Scoped Shot)
Base damage decreased from 15 to 12
Note: Scoped shot damage multiplier remains unchanged
Headshot damage multiplier increased from 2x to 2.5x
Players must now wait for the unscoping animation to completely finish before scoping
Infra-Sight
Ultimate cost increased by 10%
Developer Comments: In the right hands, Widowmaker can often feel unstoppable—even when just landing body shots instead of critical heads shots. The changes to her alternate fire weaken body shot damage while leaving her headshot damage unchanged. Additionally, we felt her Ultimate ability, Infra-Sight, was coming up a little too frequently, especially considering its impact on the game.
BUG FIXES
General
Improved stability of the High Bandwidth option in Custom Games
Heroes
Fixed a bug that allowed Mercy to gain Ultimate charge whenever damage boosting an ally who was attacking a barrier or Ice Wall
Fixed a bug that allowed Reaper to Shadow Step to unintended locations on certain maps
Maps
Fixed an issue with collision on certain areas of Dorado not blocking line of sight
